  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Iceland reported 75 new cases of COVID-19 on September 18 in the country’s largest daily increase since April 1. People under the age of 40 make up 80% of the cases diagnosed in the past week. Random testing will be performed in the Reykjavik area due to the increase in new cases, and the Chief Epidemiologist reminded Icelanders to stay home if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19. Pubs and nightclubs in Reykjavik will be closed from September 18 to September 27 in response to the spike in cases. Restaurants and cafes will be permitted to remain open. A mandatory mask policy has been put in place at all secondary schools and universities in Reykjavik after a number of cases were connected to schools in the capital region. The two-test border entry system that was put in place in August will remain until at least October 5. The Icelandic government also announced that those who are exposed to infected persons now only need to spend 7 days in isolation if they are able to present negative test results.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Chief Epidemiologist of Iceland said that he believes the country is mostly finished with its second wave of COVID-19. As of September 7, Iceland has 76 active cases, and most new cases have been people already in quarantine due to a known exposure point. As a result, the government eased a number of restrictions. The gathering limit was increased from 100 to 200 people, and Icelanders only need to keep one-metre of distance from one another, not two. Pools and gyms are also able to move from 50% to 75% capacity, while restaurants and bars must continue to close at 11 pm. At least three people have tested positive on their second test after initially testing negative since Iceland introduced their new border testing scheme a few weeks ago. The Chief Epidemiologist said that this means the testing requirement will likely be in place indefinitely -- even as domestic restrictions are eased. All members of the government who were exposed to COVID-19 at a hotel in August have since tested negative twice, allowing them to leave self-isolation.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Chief Epidemiologist of Iceland said that he is encouraged by the declining number of cases domestically and remains optimistic that the country has its recent outbreaks under control. Police may now issue fines to anyone who violates mandatory mask or social distancing regulations. Businesses or persons who do not enforce the regulations are also subject to a fine. Nearly all members of the Icelandic government will be tested for COVID-19 twice over the coming days after they were exposed to a staff member at a hotel who later tested positive. All ministers returned a negative result for their first test, but will be tested again as a precaution. More than five cases are now connected to the staff member and the hotel where they worked is now shut down temporarily.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on August 19, every traveller to Iceland (including Icelanders) will be required to be tested upon arrival, spend four or five days in quarantine, and then get tested again to limit the effect of false negatives. The new restrictions come into effect after the Chief Epidemiologist recommended them due to increasing domestic infection levels in Iceland. However, public health officials said the government did not need to introduce further domestic restrictions at this time. Spectators will be allowed at professional sports events from August 14, though all attendees must respect social distancing guidelines and stay in their assigned section. Physical contact between athletes is also permitted, but they must maintain two metres of distance in all locker room areas.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Iceland reported 17 new domestic cases on August 6, recording the country’s largest single-day increase since April 9. After exiting the country’s border testing scheme in mid-July, deCode Genetics has offered its assistance to the government due to the strain on the country’s testing capacity. Iceland is considering limiting the number of passengers who arrive in the country, though the Transport Minister said that this would only be implemented as a last resort. Due to the worsening situation in Europe, it is unlikely that any more countries will be exempted from border testing for the foreseeable future. The government is set to meet in the coming days to discuss expanding border testing, implementing a five-day quarantine period for those who are tested, and another possible reduction in the gathering limit. Elementary schools in Iceland are expected to open as scheduled in late August; secondary schools and universities will have the option to continue remote learning. Icelandic police said they will begin to fine businesses who do not respect social distancing regulations after weekend inspections revealed crowded bars and restaurants in Reykjavik.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in Iceland have caused the government to reintroduce some lockdown restrictions just ahead of a major holiday weekend in the country. On July 31, gathering limits were lowered from 500 to 100 people, and social distancing will be mandatory in public spaces for the first time since May 25. Bars and gyms in Iceland must close if they cannot guarantee social distancing can be respected. Visits to long-term care facilities and prisons have been restricted. Masks must be worn at all other services where social distancing cannot be maintained, including personal care services and on public transit. These mandatory mask policies are the first recommendation of mask use in Iceland. Despite these new restrictions, Iceland will not raise its level of emergency for now, but indicated it was willing to do so if outbreaks continue. There are now over 50 active cases in Iceland, with 39 of those known to have been transmitted domestically. All domestic cases have been diagnosed since July 23--after the country had gone nearly three weeks without any new domestic cases.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of active cases in Iceland rose sharply over the weekend of July 25 after the first cases of community transmission in over three weeks were reported. Public health officials have been unable to finalize contact tracing for two of the cases, and it is unclear how or when they were infected. A number of cases are connected to a temporary worker who arrived in the country on July 15, and due to a loophole did not undergo a second test or modified quarantine. The government had previously been considering waiving the modified quarantine period for Icelandic residents, though it is unclear how the new cases may impact the plan. The regulation was brought into effect on July 13 after outbreaks were connected to two Icelanders who tested negative at the border but then tested positive less than a week later. There have been no reports of any false negatives from July 13 until this past weekend. The National University Hospital virology department took over the entirety of the country’s border testing scheme on July 20, renovating their facilities and hiring new staff to assist in the effort. Around 45,000 Icelanders have taken advantage of the domestic tourism voucher offered by the government to support local tourism companies and encourage domestic travel.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 16, Iceland exempted travellers from Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Norway from testing at the border to reduce strain on testing capacity. A number of flights to the country were at risk of being cancelled after Icelandic authorities came very close to reaching their testing capacity in recent days. DeCode Genetics decided to extend their participation in the border testing scheme by one week (to July 20) due to the strain on the country’s testing capacity. Iceland also opened its border to 14 non-EU countries on July 15, and is allowing international students from all countries to enter the country. Iceland will expand its gathering limit from 500 to 1000 people on August 3, immediately after a major holiday weekend in the country. Restaurants and bars will be able to expand their operating hours on the same date. Public health officials are worried that large groups of people will hold their own events over the summer holidays, despite the cancellation of official festivals. Authorities are highlighting the lack of infrastructure and difficulty of contact tracing that make these spontaneous events so dangerous.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">An Icelandic genome research company that has been heavily involved in the country’s effort to test incoming travellers at the border said it would no longer participate in Iceland’s testing scheme as of July 13. The CEO of deCode Genetics said that his company had repeatedly requested that the government take over all testing at the border, and that he believed that the government could easily handle the increased quantity of tests by providing the National University Hospital (NUH) with the resources to increase their capacity. As a result, Iceland is altering its strategy to test bundles of ten samples at once, and will only test individual samples if there is a positive result from the batch. The government acknowledged that this strategy increases the likelihood of unreliable results, but is moving forward with it due to the low percentage of positive tests at the border. DeCode Genetics did not have a written contract with the government to perform tests at the border and was therefore able to pull out at any time. Icelandic residents returning from abroad will have to undergo a modified five-day quarantine that offers limited freedom to go out upon their return to the country. They may go grocery shopping, use public transport, and see friends and family in small groups--but they cannot have close contact with anyone or attend large events. Icelanders may leave self-isolation after they test negative for a second time.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A new outbreak in Iceland is connected to an Icelandic woman who flew from the US, tested negative at the border, and then tested positive eight days later after coming into close contact with numerous people. As a result, the Chief Epidemiologist said that a planned expansion of the gathering limit to 2000 people from 500 on July 13 would likely be delayed. The Chief Epidemiologist also recommended that all travellers to Iceland undergo two tests, once at the border on arrival, followed by a four or five day quarantine and then another test to prevent false negatives. The Minister of Health will make the final decision on any policy changes, and it is unclear whether she will accept the recommendation. No transmissions have been identified related to the woman arriving from the US, after fears that a party she attended might have become a new outbreak. Arriving passengers began to be charged for their PCR tests at the border on July 1, after the government paid for all tests for the first two weeks after borders opened. The test will cost each traveller between $65 and $80 USD, much less than originally planned.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A nurses’ strike in Iceland has been narrowly avoided after the union and the government reached an agreement the night before the strike was set to begin. A strike would have jeopardized the country’s ability to test incoming tourists for COVID-19, and the healthcare system at large. Iceland is considering exempting travellers from certain countries from airport testing in order to allow more flights to arrive in the country each day. Testing on arrival at the border will continue through at least July. Gathering limits will be raised to 2000 people (the current limit is 500) on July 13, and the country may allow restaurants and bars to remain open past 11pm as of the same date. Iceland has been vocal in its desire to see tourists from more countries outside the EU/EEA be allowed into the Schengen Area, but continental officials have been hesitant to expand the list of countries they are considering. While Iceland is not a part of the EU, it is a part of the EEA and the Schengen Area. The EU has told the Icelandic government that if they do not comply with their travel regulations on the internal border, then the country could be cut off from the Schengen Area entirely.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Up to 500 people are now able to gather in Iceland in the country’s most recent lifting of restrictions, with fitness centres and swimming pools able to return to full capacity. Over 900 air passengers arrived in Iceland on June 15 after the country allowed access to tourists from the EU/EEA, of whom two tested positive for coronavirus and are now in isolation. The government issued new guidelines for tourists who opt to quarantine rather than get tested at the airport, saying they are subject to deportation for violating the rules and may deny them entry if they are deemed to be likely violators. The Director of Health said that the country would be able to carry on testing for COVID-19 even if nurses go on strike on June 22, as other healthcare professionals can perform the test. The Head of the Nurses’ Union fought back against this assertion, saying that the Director’s statement undermines nursing as a profession and expressing her hope that other healthcare workers will not cross the picket line in the event of a strike.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nurses in Iceland have voted overwhelmingly in favour of indefinite strike action from June 22 if their union is unable to come to an agreement with the government. As a result, numerous hospital administrators have warned the government that they will be unable to operate if their nurses go on strike, complicating the plan to open borders to tourism on June 15. Iceland has altered its COVID-19 testing plan for tourists, rescinding the ability of international arrivals to provide their own certificate of a negative test to avoid self-isolating. Tourists will need to be tested upon arrival, or must submit to a mandatory two-week quarantine. Furthermore, Iceland has announced that it will not permit tourism for people from outside the EU/EEA until restrictions to the Schengen area as a whole are clarified. Those restrictions were previously scheduled to be lifted concurrently with Iceland’s, but the European Commission recently extended their duration until at least July 1. At the same time that border restrictions are loosened on June 15, Iceland will raise its gathering limit to 500 people (previous limit was 200).</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The reopening of borders on June 15 will go ahead as scheduled after the government stated last week that it was still attempting to figure out testing protocols for tourists. Tourists who do not wish to quarantine upon arrival will need to present a negative PCR test from the four days prior to arrival or a positive PCR test that is more than 14 days old. Nurses in Iceland are voting on strike action this week after working without a contract for more than a year. If approved, the strike is scheduled to begin on June 22 and will affect 2500 nurses at all public healthcare clinics just one week after borders to the country reopen.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After most remaining lockdown restrictions were lifted on May 25, social distancing regulations have become optional rather than enforced. Absentee voting in Iceland’s presidential election is now underway, with citizens allowed to vote in-person over the next month at a number of different polling locations. Voting is being conducted in geographic stages, with those in the capital region going first, followed by more rural areas. The Minister of Health has said that the government will announce next week whether they will be able to proceed with the country’s planned opening of borders on June 15. This statement comes after questions have been raised about the government’s airport testing plan, as testing capacity and staffing levels remain low and the cost per test (which the government is planning to cover) remains high. Some revisions to the plan may be made, including shifting the cost of testing to tourists and recruiting private companies to help with testing capacity.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Icelandic government has said that gatherings of up to 200 people will be allowed from May 25th (previous limit was 50). On the same date, bars that do not serve food can reopen, but must close at 11pm, at the same time as the previously opened restaurant industry. Swimming pools were permitted to reopen at half their regular capacity on May 18th, while fitness centres will be able to do the same on May 25th. Iceland will be capable of testing up to 1000 tourists per day following the reopening of the border on June 15th, and has said that the state will pay for the tests for the time being.</p>
