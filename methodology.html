      <h5>Data on Reopening Policies</h5>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      On an ongoing basis, our research team classifies the reopening policies of 44 jurisdictions: 34 OECD countries, 5 US states, and 5 Canadian provinces.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      For each jurisdiction, we classify a total of 9 different sectors: Stores/Non-Essential Businesses, Schooling/Youth Activities, Eateries, Leisure Activities, Contact Services, Manufacturing/Construction, Gatherings, Borders/Movement, and Cultural.  
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      Each sector is assigned a level of reopening from Level 1 (Complete Lockdown) to Level 5 (Unrestricted Access). For a full description of each category, see <a href="https://nrkthompson.github.io/ChartHolding/IndicatorCriteria.pdf">Reopening Indicators</a>.  
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      We rely on a combination of official government statements and media coverage to make these classifications.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      Note that the classification of OECD countries is primarily based on policies in place at the national level. Likewise, the classification of the 5 US states and 5 Canadian provinces is primarily based on policies in place at the state/provincial level. In both instances, there may be additional policy variation at the local level.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">

      <h5>Twitter Data</h5>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      The Twitter data is provided by colleagues at the <a href="https://mediaecosystemobservatory.com/">Media Ecosystem Observatory (MEO)</a>. It aims to capture the entire Canadian Twitter conversation. To do so, MEO identified a set of politicians, political journalists, public intellectuals, and Canadian-specific hashtags and collected every Twitter user that touched one of these themes or individuals. MEO then evaluated each individual, looking at their follower or friending behaviour, biographies, self-identified location, and hashtag use and included them in the sample if they were determined to be algorithmically likely to be Canadian. The dataset continues to grow as new users are identified.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      The dataset contains approximately 200,000 tweets a day. MEO divides the dataset into two groups: (1) the public; and (2) MPs, senators, and journalists. The analysis uses a 10% sample of the public’s daily tweets and the full set of daily tweets from MPs, senators, and journalists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      For each group, the percentages reported in the graphs reflect the proportion of daily tweets containing one or more keywords associated with the particular topic.

      <h5>Survey Data</h5>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      The measures of participation in social distancing and of government approval are derived from a series of surveys of Canadians run in partnership with the <a href="https://mediaecosystemobservatory.com/">Media Ecosystem Observatory (MEO)</a>. Each survey has a sample size of approximately 2,500 people. For each survey, we worked with a leading sample provider to generate a nationally representative, online sample of Canadians. In addition, following data collection, we applied survey weights to each survey so that—within each province—the sample is representative of the population age and gender.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
        <i>Aggregate Measure of Participation in Social Distancing</i>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      We asked Canadians whether, as a result of the pandemic, they had taken any of the 6 following actions: avoided crowded places; avoided in-person contact with friends, family, and acquaintances; maintained 2 metre distance from others; avoided domestic travel; avoided public transit; and avoided the grocery store at peak times. The graph displays the percentage of these measures taken by the average survey participant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
        <i>Net Approval of Government Handling of the Pandemic - By Region</i>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
      We asked Canadians whether they approved of how each level of government (the federal government, their provincial government, and their local government) was handling the coronavirus pandemic so far. To obtain a net approval score, participants’ answers were coded as follows: strongly approve (1); somewhat approve (0.5); neither approve, nor disapprove (0); somewhat disapprove (-0.5); and strongly disapprove (-1). The graph displays the average score.
