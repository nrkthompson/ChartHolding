  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p>Even though Australia maintains a low level of new infections nationwide, Victoria, its second-largest state, has logged more than ten new cases per day for the past week, accounting for almost all the locally acquired cases. Victoria is extending its state of emergency until July 19. Six local government areas have been designated as outbreak hotspots, and so traveling to and from these areas is discouraged. These hotspots will be targeted with extra testing, pop-up clinics and “door-to-door” engagement from health officials. Responding to Victoria’s request, the Australian Defence Force will provide more than 1,000 personnel to help with the COVID-19 response. There are large variations between the pace of reopening in different states, but further relaxation is expected at the start of July. However, Victoria will be reversing part of its easing plan by reducing the maximum number of people at gatherings, events and businesses. While the least-affected states allow for 100 or more people at gatherings, only 10 to 20 are permitted in the most affected states. The maximum number of people at home gatherings ranges from 20 to unlimited. For restaurants, cafes and pubs the lowest capacity limits are 20 patrons; by contrast, the Northern Territory and Western Australia have scrapped capacity limits as long as physical distancing rules are followed. Hairdressers and other beauty services are allowed to operate subject to varied restrictions. Intrastate travels are generally unrestricted except for travel to hotspot areas, but different interstate travel policies persist. Queensland and Western Australia still have their border closed, but no border restrictions remain in the Australian Capital Territory. Libraries, gyms, and retail shopping for non-essential items have reopened in most states. All students have physically returned to school.</p>

  <p>The daily increase of cases in Australia has stayed at a very low level for weeks, while most new infections are imported and where people were placed under quarantine upon arrival. At least two cases have been confirmed in people who attended mass protests inspired by George Floyd, so health authorities urge people to stay vigilant. The government is considering shortening the quarantine time period for international students and business travellers, as well as for other travellers from countries with low rates of Covid-19 infection, such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea. States have accelerated lifting their restrictions. Most businesses and services have resumed with physical distancing and hygiene measures. Businesses in most states are allowed to accommodate between 50 and 100 customers by next week while up to 20 people can gather at homes. The prime minister announced on June 12 that when states move to the third stage of their COVD-19 reopening plan, stadiums with capacities of 40,000 or less will be able to seat 25% of their capacity. All students have physically returned to school. More states are now easing their border restrictions, while 3 states have already lifted controls completely. Interstate travels are expected to be possible nationwide in mid-July. The federal government is adding pressure to the states by raising court challenges against their border control. Meanwhile, the Australian Tourism Minister has said that national borders are likely to stay closed until 2021.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p>Australia has managed to maintain a low level of case increases with new infections emerging in only two states. On June 8, the country also recorded zero new locally acquired cases for the first time since the pandemic’s peak. Most of the increases in cases are imported now. An estimated $131.4 billion will be invested in public hospitals over the next five years as additional funding to strengthen the capacity of the health system and enhance national coordination. In terms of the protests inspired by the death of George Floyd, large rallies were held at multiple locations despite concerns and warnings from health authorities. States and territories are proceeding in their reopening plans at varied paces. Most states set their maximum number of people attending gatherings at either 10 or 20 people, which is expected to increase in the following weeks. Businesses continue to operate with limited capacity. As of June 9, all students would have physically returned to school. Intrastate travel is now unlimited everywhere. While interstate borders have mostly been opened, Queensland is determined to keep its borders closed to other states. The ban on most international cruise ships has been extended until mid-September. Borders will remain closed to foreigners for the foreseeable future.</p>

  <p>Australia manages to maintain a low level of case increases, with some states seeing no new cases for weeks. Testing remains high, with 30,000 Australians being tested daily. $66 million from the Medical Research Future Fund will be invested mainly into vaccine and treatment development for COVID-19. The easing plan is being carried out across states and territories at varied paces. Most businesses have been reopening with physical distancing, hygiene and COVID-Safe work plans. The maximum number of people attending gatherings has been adopted in at least 20 states. This limit also applies to most businesses including hospitality, gyms, museums and shopping centers. The National Rugby League season returned on May 29 without spectators. Most states have lifted border restrictions, but travelling rules regarding quarantine still differ. Holiday homes are allowed to open depending on density and hygiene rules determined by states. Guidelines have been released to help return the film and TV industries to work for both domestic and international production companies. The reopening of schools continues gradually in the most affected states, while other states have fully reopened.</p>

  <p>Australia’s government has continued easing restrictions related to COVID-19 after seeing the growth factor of the disease below 1 for the past two weeks. From June 15Australian residents will be allowed to travel to Northern Territory - which currently has 0 active cases - without mandatory hotel quarantine. Australia's first human trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine have begun in Melbourne with about 130 participants between 18 and 59 years old.

Beauty salons are being allowed to reopen, and catering establishments are being allowed to operate at higher capacity. Domestic tourism has resumed, and will be fully reopened by mid-June. Interstate borders have been fully lifted, with the exception of Queensland.

  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p>Australia has seen limited growth in daily cases - under 20 on average for the past few weeks, with its Northern Territory declaring itself COVID-free after its last confirmed patient recovered. Meanwhile, people are still being urged to stay vigilant by practising physical distancing and good hygiene, and using contact tracing apps. The National Cabinet has approved the staged reopening of elective surgeries starting at 50% capacity. Australia’s states are proceeding with their own respective reopening plans at different paces - but cafes and restaurants have resumed conditional operation in most states. The reopening of shops is still in progress. The number of people attending gatherings has been capped at 10. Most states are expected to further ease their restrictive measures in the coming two weeks.</p>
