  <h5>February 8, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quebec has reported more than 10,000 cumulative COVID-19 deaths. The province reported 1,204 new cases, 58 fewer hospitalisations and nine fewer ICU patients on February 7. As of February 8, CEGEP, college, and university students in red zones may return to school more than once per month. The class capacity for theory lessons is 50%, but there is no limit for practical classes like labs. Students must maintain 1.5 m distance and wear masks. Some additional COVID-19 measures will be lifted on February 8, allowing some non-essential businesses like hair salons and museums to reopen. However, the curfew will remain for red zones and visiting private homes remains prohibited. Non-essential surgeries have resumed but are heavily backlogged. Approximately 248,000 vaccinations have been administered since December 14.</p> 
  <h5>February 1, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quebec reported 1,367 new COVID-19 cases and 46 deaths on January 30. The province’s curfew is scheduled to end on February 8, and retailers may see a reduction in restrictions. Non-essential businesses have been closed since December 25, with an 8 pm to 5 am curfew in place since January 9. A judge ruled that the province’s curfew does not apply to those experiencing homelessness. International flights must now arrive at international airports in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver or Calgary, where travellers will be tested for COVID-19 and will have to wait for their results in designated hotels for up to three days at their own expense. Hospitals may resume some surgeries that had to be postponed when the healthcare system was overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases. Quebec has invested $11 million in increasing its ability to detect new variants of the virus. Some skate parks in Montreal were converted into shelters and warming areas for those experiencing homelessness.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On January 22, Quebec reported 1,631 cases, 681 of which were in Montreal; 1,426 people were hospitalized and 212 people were in the ICU. Montreal has reported 400 COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces, schools and daycares. However, officials believe that the lockdown is working due to a falling caseload. The city’s positivity rate was 8.8% on January 22, with a reproduction rate below 1. If hospitalizations do not decline, officials said they may extend the lockdown beyond February 8. Up to ten people can now gather in places of worship during the lockdown, with funerals allowed to have up to 25 people, but singing is not permitted.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of January 16, Quebec had 9,734 active cases, including 1,474 hospitalizations. Quebec has had more than 9,000 total COVID-19 deaths. On January 15, the government imposed additional restrictions on the construction and manufacturing sector after receiving multiple non-compliance complaints. Between December 27 and January 2, the sector saw 33 outbreaks at construction sites, leading to 134 people contracting COVID-19. The entire province, except Nord-du-Quebec, is under curfew between 8 pm and 5 am. Grocery stores must close by 7:30 pm, but pharmacies and gas stations may remain open during the curfew. These measures are in effect until February 8. Indoor dining is not permitted, students in grades 5 and 6 are required to wear masks, and houses of worship must close -- except for funerals with up to 10 people. More children and adolescents have been hospitalized in this wave compared to the spring, with that age group comprising 1% of all hospitalizations, up from 0.5% previously.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 19, Quebec reported 44 deaths and 2,038 new cases after conducting 11,476 tests -- for a positivity rate at 18%. The rate of active cases at 210.71 per 100,000. The provinceÕs death rate is 90.93 per 100,000. There are over 1,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations in Quebec, which is the highest since the spring. Schools, offices and non-essential services are closed until January 11, leaving the majority of stores closed between December 25 and January 11. Grocery stores, pharmacies, liquor stores, cannabis stores, banks, hardware stores and pet stores can operate and big box stores are permitted to sell only essential items. Between December 17 and January 11, regions designated yellow were moved to orange and regions designated orange were moved to red on the provinceÕs reopening indicators. In red, restaurants, gyms, museums and theatres are closed. But, people in red zones may have outdoor gatherings in public. Outdoor hockey games can have up to eight players and one coach. Skiing is permitted.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 12, Quebec reported 1,898 new COVID-19 cases and 14 additional deaths over the past day. There were 860 hospitalizations, which is fewer than on December 11, and there were 129 people in the ICU, which is higher than on December 11. Parts of the Laurentians -- including Mont-Tremblant and St-Sauveur -- were designated red, or phase one, of the provinceÕs reopening indicators. This means that bars, indoor dining, theatres and some other venues must close and private gatherings are prohibited. Ski hills in red zones may open, which the Camp Fortune hill has done. Some of the restrictions that Camp Fortune has had to implement include patrons only taking the chair lift with family, requiring masks, patrons bringing their own ski equipment, allowing people to use the chalet for 20 minute intervals, and no food or beverages in the chalet. With the increasing number of cases in Montreal, West Island regional health authorities have begun cancelling healthcare workersÕ vacation requests.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 5, Quebec reported 2,031 new COVID-19 cases and 11 deaths. The premier announced that gatherings in Òred zonesÓ over the Christmas holidays will be prohibited. Additional regions of the eastern Bas Saint-Laurent area entered the red, or maximum, alert level on December 4. On December 4, new rules were introduced for malls that tie customer capacity to the available surface area of businesses.  Stores are required to enforce social distancing in the store and in lines outside. The fines for noncompliance are between $1,000 and $6,000.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 28, Quebec reported 1,480 new cases and 37 new deaths. The province has 678 hospitalizations and 93 people in ICU. A total of 7,000 Quebecers have died from COVID-19. Saguenay, Quebec City and Montreal have the most COVID-19 cases. The premier said that increasing hospitalizations, deaths and cases could lead to a ban on gatherings over the holidays. The province is considering allowing up to ten people to gather twice from December 24 to December 27 if they stay home the week prior and following. Saguenay will receive rapid COVID-19 tests that will be released by mid-December. The release was delayed to investigate how the tests should be used, considering that their results are less reliable. The education department is having classroom air quality tested. Medicago, a Quebec based company, is producing a plant-based COVID-19 vaccine and is in phase two trials, but hopes to enter phase three by the end of 2020.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 21, Quebec reported 1,189 new cases, 5 new deaths, and 22 more hospitalizations in the past day. Overall, Quebec has had 130,888 cases and 6,806 deaths. Montreal reports the most cases, with Saguenay and Monteregie following behind. Saguenay has the most per capita cases: 402 per 100,000 people. The Premier wants to implement a four-day relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions between December 24 and 27 -- allowing gatherings with up to ten people if people self-isolate a week before and a week after gathering. The closure of bars and restaurants, which began on October 1, is anticipated to finish on January 11.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Based on the past two weeks, the rate of COVID-19 cases in Montreal was 175.2 per 100,000 cases. On November 13, Quebec reported 1,301 daily new cases and 30 daily new deaths, meanwhile hospitalizations were 583 and ICU occupancy was 85. Out of all of the provinces, Quebec reports the most cases per capita; Montreal reports the most cases in Quebec. The lockdown in red zones including Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Lanaudiere except around Joliette, Mauricie, Centre-du-Quebec, Gaspesie is expected to continue until November 23 due to the number of cases. In response to the rising number of cases in schools, the premier may close schools temporarily. There have been over 10,000 cases linked to schools. In elementary school, masks are only required for grade five and up and students do not need to wear the mask in the classroom and instead only in the halls. High school students must wear masks all day. Authorities have signaled concerns about Christmas gatherings.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 7, Quebec reported 1,234 new cases, 11 new deaths and 16 fewer hospitalizations. As of November 7, the province had approximately 10,161 confirmed active cases. All of the Gaspesie region will be at the orange level as of November 11 when Caleto-sur-Mer and Maria progress from red, or maximum alert, to orange. As of November 10, the North of Quebec will regress from yellow, or early warning, to orange -- due to an increase in cases and recent outbreaks. Restrictions for schools will go into effect on November 11. MontrealÕs Direction regionale de sante publique has asked the government to ease restrictions for individual training at gyms and sports centers in red zones for physical and mental health. The premier said that he does not intend to lift restrictions on restaurants, gyms and sports centers in red zones.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quebec reported 952 new cases and 18 additional deaths on October 30. The premier said that Quebec had plateaued at approximately 1,000 daily new cases. The partial lockdown in red zones, including Montreal, Laval and Quebec City, was extended to November 23. The lockdown banned some indoor and outdoor gatherings, and closed bars, gyms, entertainment venues and in-person dining. Beginning October 28, patrons can be fined up to $6,000 for visiting venues that were required to close. Beginning November 2, all of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Chaudiere-Appalaches regions entered red, or the maximum, alert level. There were two outbreaks in long term care homes where 40 people have died so far.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past 24 hours on October 24, Quebec reported 1009 additional cases, bringing the total to 99,235 COVID-19 cases. Quebec City currently has the majority of active cases per 100,000 people in Quebec. On October 24, Montreal reported the highest increase in cases with 254 new cases. The premier explained that it was unlikely that restaurants in red zones would be permitted to reopen in October, as the three week lockdown for Montreal and Quebec City had closed gyms, bars, entertainment venues and most gatherings. The premier also encourages Quebecers to continue working from home.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 17, Quebec reported a new daily record of positive COVID-19 cases at 1,279 cases bringing the total number of cases to 92,297. The former high had been October 2 when they reported 1,161 cases. There are currently 517 people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 85 people in the ICU. The number of cases is increasing in Mauricie, Quebec City and Lanaudiere. The Listuguj First Nations community is locking down with the exception of critical services after reporting their first case. On October 16, the government announced that Ski Hills will be permitted to operate this season, but that hills in red zones could not offer rental equipment, dining or lessons. Hills will require social distancing, masks or scarves, and there are limitations based on family members and social bubbles that influence who people can ride lifts and gondolas with.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 9, Quebec reported 1,102 new COVID-19 cases, 4 new deaths and 8 additional hospitalizations, the highest number of new deaths in 24 hours since July 1. Should this trend for COVID-19 cases continue to increase, authorities fear that hospitals will reach capacity. On October 8, the premier said that with the rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations, other health procedures would be delayed and wait times prolonged. Montreal is on red alert, this means that sports and leisure activities outside of school are cancelled, training is limited, and indoor sports and community centres can remain open to free practice but not to competitions, group sports, the weight room or similar activities. On October 10, Trois-rivieres, Beancour, Nicolet-Yamaska, and Drummond in the center of Quebec also entered the red alert. Regulations addressing bars, restaurants and gyms consequently came into force on October 10, while regulations for schools and sports came into force on October 13. Checkpoints were used over Thanksgiving to limit travel between regions, particularly for travel between red and orange zones. In-school vaccinations were postponed this year and the Quebec government ordered 25% additional flu shot doses.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 1, Quebec reported 933 new COVID-19 cases, the highest daily case increase since early May. Over the past two weeks, Quebec has had approximately 8,500 new cases and cumulatively Quebec has reported approximately 75,000 COVID-19 cases. The Greater Montreal area, Quebec City, and the majority of the Chaudiere-Appalaches region have been designated Red Zones, where restaurants may only do delivery and take out, public gatherings can have maximum 25 people, and gatherings with people who live at different addresses is forbidden.Red zones must stay red for a minimum of 28 days. In Red Zones, there are contactless book lending, no audiences in community and cultural centres, but sports facilities and outdoor sports can continue. Fines of $1000 will be issued for illegal gatherings and for protestors who gather without masks. Police will have the ability to get emergency warrants from judges over the phone if people refuse to cooperate. The City of Montreal denied a protest permit request for a protest against COVID-19 related health regulations on October 11. On October 7, bars and restaurants will protest the Quebec governmentÕs decision to close eateries and beverage establishments in areas designated red zones.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 21, according to QuebecÕs public health director and the director of Montreal public health, Quebec is beginning its second wave. As of September 25, approximately 480 Quebec schools reported at least one COVID-19 case. In Quebec City, a school closed for two weeks following an outbreak amongst 20 students and five staff. The government indicated that it does not intend to give police the right to enter homes in order to stop illegal gatherings and parties. On September 21, health regulations became stricter for gatherings in the province and only 50 people will be permitted at religious services, although regions like Montreal and Quebec City, which are classified as orange on QuebecÕs alert system, have had their capacity limit decreased to 25. The provinceÕs public health director encourages Quebecers to limit interactions and contact with other people to minimize the transmission of COVID-19.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quebec’s premier says that, while the province is not in a second wave, the trend is not promising. Quebec’s health minister similarly suggests that so long as cases per million does not pass 25, the situation can be kept under control. Since their August reopening, approximately 246 schools in Quebec have reported at least one COVID-19 case. In the 24 hours between September 15 and 16, 303 additional people tested COVID-19+, which is the highest daily case increase since June. On September 11, karaoke was banned in bars and other public venues. As of September 12, Quebec began fining people who fail to wear masks in indoor public spaces; new COVID-19 fines range from $400 to $6000. All Quebec bars are required to retain a customer registry to permit contact tracing. As of September 14, Quebec students are permitted to participate in up to two extracurricular activities outside of the main classroom. A Quebec teachers union is suing the government for access to documents about the province’s back to school plans. The union and its members are concerned about a lack of transparency regarding the number of schools with infections and about provincial plans for school access to accelerated COVID-19 testing. A request from a group of parents for an online learning alternative was denied by a judge. The only children permitted to learn from home are those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 complications, or who live with someone at increased risk. On September 12, thousands of Montrealers protested mask wearing.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 4, approximately 50 schools and training centres reported COVID-19 cases. Quebec introduced a colour-coded system of COVID-19 alerts:  green, yellow, orange and red levels based on the epidemiological situation, control of transmission and the healthcare system in the province. The intervention system will be assessed weekly and will affect the number of people permitted at gatherings, travel between regions and non-essential service operations. The majority of regions, including Montreal, are green -- but Quebec City, Laval, Estrie and Outaouais are in yellow. Montreal’s director of public health is worried about increasing small social gatherings amongst friends and family.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quebec’s Health minister says he thinks that Quebec is currently between the first and second wave of COVID-19.  He underlined that, while cases are declining in the province, Quebec’s health network must still prepare for another wave of the virus. On August 18, Quebec presented a nine-point plan to address the expected second wave. The plan addresses the following topics: elderly living situations, vulnerable populations, the workforce, testing, outbreak prevention and control, clinical organization and services, procurement, and governance and communications. The government will also dedicate an emergency fund to hiring in public health and to procuring material resources. Despite urging parents to allow their children to resume physical school attendance from the start of the upcoming school year, Quebec’s provincial government has asked that public school boards provide contingency plans for remote schooling by September 15. Protestors have called upon the provincial government to adjust its back to school plan before classes restart. Quebec students are required to attend school unless they have a medical exemption. While physical distancing and frequent hand washing will be recommended, masks will only be required in school common areas for students in Grades 5 and up.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 12, Quebec reported for a third consecutive day of less than 100 new daily cases. Quebec’s premier reiterated that students will be returning in-person in the fall and addressed their new back to school plan. The new plan has students in grades five and up wearing masks in common areas but not in classrooms.  The plan no longer has bubbles of six students within the class but instead makes the entire class the social bubble. On August 11, Premier Legault said that there would certainly be a second wave but that it would not be as bad as the first wave because Quebec prepared for it by hiring orderlies, acknowledging the importance of PPE, and ensuring that there would be many tests available. Opposition parties and some unions have criticized the government for omitting details from their plan and for failing to address how students will catch up academically. Opposition parties in Quebec have not been eager about supporting the federal COVID Alert contact tracing app or about developing an app specific to Quebec.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 6, Quebec’s five-day average of new cases was 135. This is the lowest that it has been since approximately mid-July. The majority of new cases are located in Montreal. Since events of up to 250 people are permitted, festivals and events in Quebec may resume with social distancing and masks. Survey results indicate that approximately half of Quebecers are afraid to return to work. The government is facing a potential court challenge from a constitutional lawyer arguing that children should be given the option to return to online studies in the fall. A teachers union in Quebec is calling for the delay of school until after Labour Day. The union also raises questions about poor ventilation in schools, classes with windows that do not open, and whether masks will be mandatory and who will supply them. Quebec’s public health director said that it is unlikely that Quebec will impose a partial lockdown in the event of a second wave because of the negative impacts for the elderly and youth.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">27 people developed COVID-19 during an outbreak at a day camp in Boucherville en Montérégie at the Les Ateliers de Charlot l'Escargot camp, which led to the closure of camp from July 20 to August 7. Smaller outbreaks were reported at camps in Monteregie, Gatineau and Montreal. The government is concerned about a trend toward hosting large parties regardless of gathering limits among individuals age 15-34. As of August 3, the limit indoors for performance halls, theaters, cinemas, religious services and community halls increased from 50 to 250 with protective measures and distancing in place. Schools, colleges and universities are expected to reopen in September. The Quebec government will collaborate with CEGEPs and universities to discourage parties and plan for rapid interventions if there is an outbreak.  Schools will have social bubbles and will have teachers rotate through classrooms instead of students. Students in Grades 10 and 11 will have the option to study in person or remotely. Officials also said that the recent increase in personnel and PPE in long term care homes is allowing them to improve in the areas where they struggled most during the first wave.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 20, Quebec reported stable infection rates despite outbreaks at a healthcare facility and at four bars. On July 21, Quebec reported 180 new cases -- their highest increase since June 12. Over half of the new cases are in Montreal. Officials suspect that their slight increase in cases is due to increased testing and explain that their rate of positive tests has remained around 2% and the number of hospitalizations has remained steady or decreased. However, officials are worried about reports of private gatherings. The Grand Prix cycling races scheduled for September in Montreal and Quebec City have been cancelled. Gathering limits in indoor public places will increase from 50 to 250 people on August 3. Although preschools and elementary schools outside of the Montreal Metropolitan community (CMM) have been open since May 11, schools in the CMM will remain closed until late August. With some exceptions, secondary schools across Quebec are also expected to remain closed until the end of August. McGill University expressed some concerns about international students returning to campus and residence for the fall semester.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Masks became mandatory in public spaces across Quebec on July 13. After requesting that everyone who worked in or visited a bar in Montreal after July 1 get tested, the Quebec government is looking to increase Montreal’s testing capacity to accommodate demand. Experts have suggested that many of Quebec’s new COVID-19 cases are connected to the reopening of bars, restaurants, pools and stores. There have also been issues with people forgetting who they had been in close contact with. The Quebec government noted that increases in cases could be tied to private gatherings and bars. Officials are concerned after the positivity rate of COVID-19 tests was found to be over 3% last weekend, after being under 1% earlier this month. As of July 18, office employees (including non-essential workers) could return to offices with COVID-19 measures in place and a capacity limit of 25%, with the capacity limit expected to increase in the future. Criticism has been raised over the province’s reopening of bars and other nightlife, which is risking a spike in cases that may prevent schools from reopening in September. A widely circulated gender equality consultant’s op-ed suggested that a continued school closure would disproportionately affect women and lower-income children.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 13, masks will be mandatory on public transit. However, police will not enforce the rule, bus drivers do not want to enforce the rule, and there will not be fines for breaking this rule. The Quebec government is considering strategies to test asymptomatic carriers, to investigate regional testing and to implement testing at Quebec-US borders. As the military withdrawal from Quebec’s care homes is almost complete, 10,000 orderly students hired for medical support during the pandemic have finished school and will now enter Quebec’s health sector. The health minister warned businesses that if they fail to comply with public health regulations, they will be closed. This warning was specifically directed towards bars, and was followed by a threat to reintroduce lockdown measures for that sector. On July 10, the province implemented a number of new rules for bars. Serving hours have been reduced (must close by 1am) and there can be a maximum of 50% capacity. No dancing is permitted, all customers must be seated, and bars must collect a register of customer contact information or have one guest in each group be the contact person for that group.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 13, Quebecers will have to wear masks on public transit. Places of worship and amusement parks reopened across Quebec on June 30. Restaurants in Montreal were permitted to reopen the week of June 22, and since then there have been complaints about restaurant failures to abide by new health regulations. On July 3, eight Cineplex locations reopened in Quebec with sanitation measures. The Quebec Tourism Department explained that police will be responsible for enforcing public safety and COVID-19 rules, but to manage tourism, additional security and no-parking signs will be used. The reopening of casinos is staggered between mid-July and early August, and will include precautions such as rubber tipped pens, masks, reduced hours, increased cleaning, and closed bars and showrooms. On June 30, the Quebec government said that in September all schools would resume in person at normal capacity for elementary and high school students. Subgroups of students will be created to promote social distancing. The government encourages CEGEPs and universities to resume in person. The education ministry is preparing a plan for a possible second wave. Some parents whose children previously returned to elementary schools outside of Montreal reported positive experiences of increased social distancing, sanitation mechanisms, and rules that closed gyms and cafeterias.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quebec has over half of the positive COVID-19 cases in Canada. As of June 21, Quebec still reported more than approximately 100 new cases daily and multiple deaths; however, the number of hospitalizations and ICU patients has decreased for weeks.  The government is encouraging capacity limits, handwashing, and masks. On June 22, Quebec and Montreal progressed in easing some COVID-19 health restrictions. Like the rest of the province, people in the Greater Montreal Area can have gatherings of maximum 10 people from three different households. As well, dine-in restaurants, mall food courts, gyms, indoor pools, public and private beaches, arenas, religious places, concert halls, theatres, cinemas, and day camps have reopened with restrictions. Long-term care facilities may allow visitors. Montreal’s airport will require masks, take temperatures, only allow passengers and employees to enter, check passengers for symptoms at checkpoints, reserve parking online, conduct self check-in and baggage drop, and increase hand washing and sanitizing stations. Self-isolation in Quebec is not required after interprovincial travel.</p>
