  <p>The government of Nova Scotia is limiting mass gatherings to a maximum of 50 people for both indoor and outdoor gatherings. Public schools and pre-primary education will remain closed for the remainder of the 2019/20 school year, while daycare services and unlicensed childcare providers have been allowed to resume activities in accordance with the province’s ministry of health. Personal services – such as barbers, spas, salons, and body art establishments have been allowed to resume business, along with fitness establishments – such as gyms, yoga studios, and climbing facilities – have been allowed to reopen if they are able to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres between patrons, or a limit of ten patrons at any given time if the appropriate distance cannot be maintained. Restaurants are being allowed to operate at 50% capacity while maintaining a minimum physical distance of 2 metres between tables, or providing customers with a physical barrier between tables if this distance cannot be maintained.</p>
