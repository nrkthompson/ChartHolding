  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p>Phase 2 of Albertaâ€™s relaunch strategy came into effect on June 12 with additional businesses and services reopening. In phase 2 grades K-12 can resume for diploma exams and summer school only. Along with retail businesses and hairstylists, wellness and personal services, libraries, cinemas and theatres can reopen. Indoor recreation, fitness, and sports facilities can now reopen in phase 2. An infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary critiques that this limits government ability to monitor progress between phases. Many small businesses are struggling with PPE shortages, recalling laid-off workers,  implementing new measures to protect staff and customers, and financial burdens. There is no limit on the number of people allowed at worship gatherings or eateries, but there is a maximum of 50 attendees at indoor gatherings and 100 at outdoor events. Sports teams may play in region-only cohorts of up to 50 players. In phase 2, households may increase their social bubbles to a maximum of 15 people. Non-essential travel outside the province is not recommended and restrictions are still in place for major festivals, conferences, nightclubs and amusement parks.</p>
