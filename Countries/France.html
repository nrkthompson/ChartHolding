  <h5>February 8, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On February 6, France reported 20,586 new cases, hospitalisations fell by 245 and ICU patients decreased by 20. France will not impose a national lockdown. Ski lifts are expected to stay closed until at least March. Borders will be closed to people from countries outside of the EU. Travellers must have a negative virus test. As of February 8, children cannot wear homemade facemasks to school; only surgical masks and Category 1 fabric masks are permitted. Not wearing a mask can lead to a 135 euro fine. France has received 273,600 AstraZeneca vaccines. Approximately 1.86 million people in France have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; 247,260 people have been fully vaccinated.</p> 
  <h5>February 1, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On January 31, France reported 19,235 new cases, bringing the country to 3.19 million total cases -- the second most cases in Europe. Over 60% of ICU beds in the country are being used for COVID-19 cases. There have been over 75,000 COVID-19 deaths nationwide, the seventh most deaths globally. The number of COVID-19 infections, hospital admissions, and deaths have been increasing steadily. The country’s border closed to non-EU citizens on January 31 to stop the spread of COVID-19. People from EU countries are required to provide a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival. On the same date, France closed large shopping centres and is discouraging overseas travel. The prime minister implemented additional police checks to catch curfew violators, to stop parties and to prevent restaurants from reopening. Some health professionals expressed their disagreement with the government’s decision not to implement a lockdown to curb the spread, saying there could be another wave of COVID-19 due to the B117 variant.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On January 22, France reported 23,292 new cases and 649 additional deaths in the past day. There is increasing pressure on the French hospital system with more than 2,900 people in the ICU; however, the number of people in intensive care has fallen over the past few days. Ski resorts will not reopen by February as was previously hoped for, and the government said it may impose additional restrictions. The national assembly indicated its support for extending the country’s health emergency from February 16 until June 1, allowing the government to impose additional restrictions. The senate will receive the bill for the extension on January 27. The national curfew between 6 pm and 6 am remains in place, but schools, offices, department stores, and hairdressers remain open. Approximately one million people in France have been vaccinated.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France has now reported approximately 70,000 deaths from COVID-19, the seventh highest death toll in the world. The number of new daily infections has plateaued at around 20,000 daily cases, but hospitalizations and ICU occupancy continue to rise. Although the lockdown measures were scheduled to end soon, public officials are contemplating whether or not to extend them. France continues to have a curfew, while eateries, cafes, theatres and cultural venues remain closed. A new curfew time of 6 pm to 6 am was introduced on January 18. Some stores want to open at 7:30 am to make up for lost sales caused by the reduced hours. To ensure curfew compliance, police are using checkpoints. On January 4, schools reopened and many people returned to work. Authorities said that the scheduled reopening date of January 20 for restaurants and cafes is unlikely to hold. France is working on improving its vaccine rollout after a slow start.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has increased since last week and is now at 13,700 cases per day. FranceÕs second stage of reopening began on December 15, with an 8 pm to 6 am curfew instead of a stay-at-home lockdown. After 6 pm, no one is allowed to leave their homes unless they have an emergency, are going to work, or are traveling. Restaurants and cafŽs will remain closed until at least January 20. Curfew measures will be lifted on December 24, but not on December 31. On December 20, France announced that it would suspend all travel from the United Kingdom, including the transport of goods, for 48 hours. The decision came after the president called an emergency health council meeting to discuss how to react to the UK government tightening COVID-19 measures due to the spread of a new strain of the virus that could be up to 70% more infectious. On December 17, the president tested positive for COVID-19, especially worrying after he attended an EU summit of leaders the week prior. He remains in stable condition. La Haute AutoritŽ de SantŽ said that people who have already had a symptomatic form of the virus will not ÔsystematicallyÕ need a vaccine.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has slightly increased since last week and is now at 12,000 cases per day. FranceÕs second stage of reopening is set to begin on December 15, with lockdown measures set to be lifted and replaced with a curfew. However, France did not reach its required thresholds of 5,000 average new daily COVID-19 cases and 2,500-3,000 patients in the ICU to end the lockdown. Accordingly, the lockdown will be replaced with an 8 pm to 6 am curfew, but museums, cinemas and theatres will remain closed. After 6 pm, no one is allowed to leave their homes unless they have an emergency, are going to work, or are travelling. Restaurants and cafŽs will remain closed until at least January 20. Bars and nightclubs are closed indefinitely. Ski lifts and other facilities are closed until January 7. Curfew measures will be lifted on December 24, but not on December 31. Vaccine skepticism is growing: recent polls show that 61% of French people would not get the COVID vaccine when it becomes available.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has decreased since last week and is now plateauing at around 10,500 cases per day. FranceÕs second stage of reopening is set to begin on December 15 -- with lockdown measures set to be lifted and replaced with a curfew. However, France must reach an average of 5,000 new daily COVID-19 cases and at most 2,500-3,000 patients in the ICU to move to the second stage; currently, these metrics are at 10,500 and 3,200, respectively. Public health experts warned that the country is not on track to hit the December 15 goal. The French government is facing a large anti-vaccination movement: only 53% of the population say they would get vaccinated -- one of the lowest uptake rates in Europe. Vaccine rollout is set to begin in January. Nursing homes will be first in line before the programme is extended in February to the vulnerable elderly and those with underlying health conditions. By spring, the vaccine is expected to be available to the rest of the population. Vaccination will be free for everyone and will not be mandatory.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has decreased significantly and is now half of last weekÕs average -- standing currently at 12,000 cases per day. On November 24, the president announced a three-stage easing of restrictions over the next two months. The first stage started on November 28, when shops reopened under strict hygiene restrictions and people could start leaving their homes for an extended radius of 20 kilometres for up to three hours. On December 15, if the number of cases remain below 5,000 and ICU occupancy is between 2,500 and 3,000, the lockdown will be lifted with cinemas and museums reopening. Large family gatherings will still be discouraged between December 24 and January 1. If the number of cases continues to decrease by January 20, restaurants, cafes and gyms will resume, but bars and nightclubs will remain closed indefinitely. With high vaccine skepticism in France and rising conspiracy theories and suspicion about government policies, the president sought to reassure people about the measures the government would take to ensure the vaccine would be safe -- including involving a scientific committee and a citizens' collective.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs seven-day moving average of new cases decreased to 23,000 cases per day: a positive sign that the lockdown measures may be working. This past week, hospital admissions fell 13% and the number of new intensive care patients was down 9%. The weekly number of deaths have decreased by 300 this week. Having been in an intense nationwide lockdown since October 30, the French are starting to prepare for the end of lockdown measures during the first week of December. Shops are preparing for Black Friday shopping ahead of the Christmas holidays. However, the government has insisted that lockdown measures will remain for now. The president is expected to address the nation on November 24 on the prospects for travel and family gatherings for the fast-approaching Christmas break. A recent Ipsos study found that only 54% of French citizens would get a COVID-19 vaccine if one were available, the lowest rate of any country surveyed.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After two weeks of an intense national lockdown, FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has drastically decreased to 27,000 cases per day -- half of what it was a week ago. However, daily deaths remain constant at around 550 per day. Although France now has more patients hospitalized with COVID-19 than during the April peak of the initial wave, there are about 2,000 fewer in intensive care. Experts attribute this to healthcare workers having more information about the virus now than in April. Despite the improving situation, the prime minister announced that the lockdown measures would remain in place until December as scheduled. Any loosening of restrictions after December 1 would be "strictly limited" to certain businesses to facilitate Christmas shopping, and would exclude bars, restaurants and sports halls. A nation-wide survey showed that 60% of people had flouted the rules at least once, either by giving a false reason for going out on their self-signed permission slip or by meeting up with family and friends. The proportion of rule-breakers stood at 40 percent during the first wave.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has increased again by more than 10,000 cases in one week and is now at 54,000 cases per day. The nation confirmed a record 87,000 new COVID-19 cases on November 7. As of that day, 87.2% of intensive-care capacity was occupied by patients infected with the virus, an increase from 85.4% on November 6. In mid-August, the rate touched a low of around 7% after peaking at nearly 139% in April. After processing two million tests last week, the average positivity rate of tests stood at 20.6%. Meanwhile, the health minister is debating whether checks should be carried out on people who test positive for COVID-19 to make sure they are isolating at home. This came after reports of asymptomatic individuals who knew that they had COVID-19 and were still going to work. The country is currently in an intense lockdown, and the government has not announced more restrictions on top of those implemented last week.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases increased again by 10,000 cases to 41,000 cases per day. The second wave is poised to overwhelm hospitals in a matter of days. The president admitted that curfews imposed during this last month have been ineffective in stopping the spread. Accordingly, as of October 30, all bars, restaurants and non-essential businesses (including hairdressers) are forced to close, and written statements are required for people to leave their homes. People are only allowed to leave home for work, school, visiting a dependent relative, grocery shopping, or jogging for an hour. Unlike the two-month lockdown imposed last spring, students up to high-school level will continue to go to school. However, all students aged 6 and above must wear masks at all times. Universities will have online classes only. Factories and farms will be allowed to operate, and some public services will function, to limit the economic damage that would come from shutting down the country completely. Defying government orders, mayors of 50 cities and towns plan to bring in local edicts allowing some shops, such as florists, toy shops and bookstores, to remain open.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases increased by 10,000 cases in one week to 31,000 cases per day. COVID-19 patients occupy more than 42% of ICU beds nationally, and 64% in the Paris region. The French government has expanded an overnight curfew it imposed in eight urban areas of France last week to encompass 38 more regions and Polynesia. The 9pm to 6am curfew and other public health measures will last till at least December. This means that 46 million of FranceÕs 67 million people will be under curfews that prohibit them from being out during those hours except for limited reasons, such as walking a dog, traveling to and from work and catching a train or flight. On October 22, France rebranded its failed ÒStopCovidÓ tracing app and renamed it ÒTous Anti-CovidÓ (all against Covid), which has since seen an additional 1.2 million downloads for a total number of about 4 million. In an effort to assuage concerns of many in France over privacy, the updated app now instructs users to switch Bluetooth on only when they are in close proximity with other people, like on the subway or at parties because Òit makes no sense to leave it on all the time.Ó</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases is 21,000, 5,000 higher than last week; last weekÕs figure also increased by 5,000 from the prior week. For the first time since July, France is in an official state of emergency, with curfews applying to the eight regions in the maximum alert level, including Paris, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier and Toulouse, affecting nearly a third of the country's population. The curfews, which take effect at 9 p.m. and are lifted at 6 a.m. each morning, will last four weeks and force all non-essential businesses to close during that time. During curfew, people will need a certificate for permitted activities, such as travel to or from work, for medical attention, to visit a dependent relative, or to walk a dog. The government says a curfew is the only way to avoid another crippling lockdown, but critics say that it is counter-intuitive because it comes ahead of a two-week school holiday without travel restrictions, raising the prospect that huge numbers of families will flee cities for the countryside.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases is 16,000, which is 5,000 more than last week, owing to an alarming surge in cases over the weekend, when confirmed cases reached 27,000 on October 10. As regions move up the 5-tier system, restrictions are automatically imposed; the country's maximum alert level kicks in when the incidence rate of the virus exceeds 250 cases per 100,000 people, and at least 30% of intensive care beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients. Hospitals in Paris moved into emergency mode on October 8, after COVID-19 patients took up half of the region's intensive care beds. On October 10, the cities of Lille, Lyon, Grenoble and Saint-Etienne joined Paris and Marseille reached the maximum alert level. Accordingly, bars are shut, and restaurants are forced to stop service by 10PM. The federal government continues to be criticized for not requiring people to work from home, a measure that is officially Òencouraged.Ó</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases is 11,500, which is slightly lower than last week. Hospitalizations and ICU capacity continue to rise at an alarming rate, with 4,000 new Covid-19 admissions in the past 7 days and 844 Covid-19 patients are currently in intensive care. The Conseil Scientifique says that hospitals could be overwhelmed Òwithin a few weeksÓ and there could be a Òrise in mortality linked to Covid-19, but also other illnesses due to disorganization in the health care system.Ó Data shows that new COVID-19 cases in Paris are above the 250 per 100,000 threshold, triggering the maximum alert protocol. Accordingly, Paris will shut all bars completely from October 6 for at least two weeks. Restaurants in the city will have to put in place new sanitary arrangements in order to stay open, and university lecture halls must be no more than half-full. Marseille bars, restaurants and gyms will stay closed for at least one more week. Despite the second wave, downloads of FranceÕs StopCovid app remain at 3 million, not having increased since the Fall surge began.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">FranceÕs 7-day moving average of new cases is 12,180, which is two thousand more cases than last week. Hospitalizations and ICU capacity continue to rise at an alarming rate, nearing their maximum capacity in southern France. Accordingly, hospitals in the Paris and Marseille regions have begun delaying scheduled operations to free up space for COVID-19 patients. On September 23, the central government ordered all bars and restaurants to close completely in the southern city of Marseille starting September 26 for two weeks. In Paris and Lille, cafŽs and bars were ordered to close as of 10 p.m. starting after the weekend of September 28. This discrepancy caused an uproar amongst restaurant and bar owners in Marseille, and the municipality of Marseille symbolically joined the protesters when a deputy mayor announced that municipal police would not fine bar and cafŽ owners if their premises were found open. The health minister then offered a concession on September 25, closing bars and cafes as of September 28 and only for a week. Prime Minister Jean Castex said that he has not downloaded FranceÕs contact tracing app StopCovid because he does not use public transportation enough to be concerned.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s 7-day moving average of new cases is 10,230, which is a record for the country during the pandemic. France uses hospitalization and ICU capacity as metrics to help with their reopening and closing policies. Over the past 7 days, there were 3,223 more hospitalisations -- of which 535 were intensive care admissions. Across the country, 50 departments are now above the alert threshold of 50 new cases per 100,000 people.  Every department has reached the threshold of “vigilance”, meaning there have been more than 10 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past seven days. Infections are particularly high among young people, prompting the government to mandate face masks outdoors and in workplaces. The government also pledged to boost COVID-19 tests, reinforce control of self-isolation conditions, and impose stricter rules in high risk zones -- but it has ruled out a new nationwide lockdown. Instead, France's major southern cities of Bordeaux, Marseille and Nice -- classified as red zones -- have banned public gatherings of 10 people in parks and beaches and have reduced the public-event attendance capacities to 1,000 people from the previous 5,000 person limit. People are urged to limit visits to nursing homes and not to eat and drink in bars while standing.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s daily new COVID-19 cases rose by more than 8,500 for the third time in six days on September 9. The disease is spreading at its fastest pace since it emerged in the country. France uses hospitalization and ICU capacity as metrics to help with their reopening and lockdown policies. The number of people hospitalized has reached a one-month high of 5,003, with ICU capacity mimicking levels seen at the end of June (600). However, the current metrics remain well below what was seen during the peak in April -- largely due to the recent increase in cases involving younger people. As of September 9, the government has yet to take additional steps to counter the high infection rates, but the country’s scientific council warned that they would have to take multiple unpopular decisions within days. They indicated that they are two weeks away from Spain’s situation, and the fact that new cases had not yet swamped the health system might have created "a false sense of security." The council will consider the possibility of introducing local lockdowns, especially in hard-hit areas like Marseille. On September 1, around 12 million students returned to school. If a school reports more than three COVID-19 cases, then it will temporarily close; out of 60,000 schools across the country, 22 have closed within the first week.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">For the first time since the two-month lockdown ended in May, France reported more than 4,500 cases on August 23. The nation’s seven-day moving average of new cases increased by one thousand since last week, now standing at 3,481. Health Minister Olivier Véran said infections were four times higher in the 20 to 40 age group than the rest of the population--the result of summer parties. Veran has ruled out another nationwide lockdown because all other metrics (namely hospitalizations, ICU capacity and deaths) are generally stable. The application of masks has been made compulsory in the workplace as of September 1, after a quarter of COVID-19 clusters were discovered to have originated in the workplace. Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that students in secondary and high schools must wear a mask--regardless of distancing measures. In September, in-person schooling will be compulsory for all.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s seven-day moving average of new cases now stands at 2,364 after the weekend of August 15-17, which saw the country add 10,000 cases. Paris and Marseille have both been declared COVID-19 “red zones,” meaning that the virus is actively and rapidly circulating among inhabitants. However, hospitalizations and ICU admission levels remain relatively stable in part because younger people--who have experienced bigger increases in infection compared to older individuals--are less likely to develop complications from the virus. The government is set to propose the introduction of compulsory masks in shared workspaces later this week and Paris authorities have expanded their list of outdoor spaces/streets where mask wearing is mandatory. France is deploying riot police to enforce masks after violence broke out last week. Due to the recent surge, the United Kingdom has enforced a two-week quarantine requirement for people coming from France starting August 15.  France is set to apply reciprocal measures this week. France will release more details regarding school reopening this week.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s seven-day moving average of new cases--now standing at 1,351--has risen in the last week by almost 50 percent. Despite the surge in new cases, the number of people hospitalized for the disease continues to go down, by 88 to 5,060--extending a 10-week-long trend. Because of the increase in cases, wearing a face mask in busy outdoor parts of Paris (river banks, Champs-Elysee Avenue, markets, parks, etc.) is mandatory as of August 10. Executives from Air France-KLM and Lufthansa Group have called on the Canadian government to remove travel restrictions on EU nationals. As the epidemiological situation of France worsens, executives in the tourism industry worry that countries (even within the EU) will add France to their quarantine list.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France reported 3,376 new COVID-19 cases over the first weekend of August. The number of people being treated in ICUs for the disease has increased for the first time since April. Many experts acknowledge that France is experiencing a resurgence, which has been attributed to various bars that opened in mid-July. Although mask wearing became mandatory in all indoor public places across the nation last month, rules on wearing masks outdoors in the hardest-hit parts of France (Lille and Nice) took effect on August 3. Pressure is growing on the government to mandate the use of masks outdoors nationwide. Although the government does not want to resort to another nationwide lockdown, it has yet to close any regions with outbreaks.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s daily coronavirus infection rate is on the rise again. More than 1,130 new cases were reported on July 24, making July's figures similar to those seen in May. The nation’s R-rate has risen to 1.3 from 1.2 last week. Although the country is preparing for a second wave, no closure policies have been reinforced yet. As of last week, people in France must wear face masks in all indoor establishments, and working from home is still recommended. Jean Castex, the French Prime Minister, is urging the French not to travel to Catalonia, especially Barcelona, due to an active outbreak there. France announced mandatory testing for any arrivals from 16 countries, including the US.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the number of active cases continues to increase in France, the nation’s R rate has risen to 1.2. The Brittany region’s R rate rose from 0.92 to 2.62 in just five days. President Macron—who had previously announced that face masks would become obligatory on August 1—moved up the date to July 20 following concerns over “slight signs” of resurgence. Wearing a mask will now be mandatory in public establishments, with a 135-euro fine for non-compliance. On July 15 Disneyland Paris partially reopened, as did the top floor of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">French officials warned that the R-rate is now above 1.0; 71 clusters of outbreaks are being investigated and contacts traced. Sewage testing indicates that traces of COVID-19 in Parisian non-drinking water over the past 14 days have increased. Professor Jean François Delfraissy, head of the government’s scientific advisory body, noted that "barrier gestures" that prevent the spread of COVID-19 are being “abandoned” in France--as even ministers in the new cabinet exchanged kisses and hugs during their swearing-in ceremonies. The municipality of Nice is considering making wearing masks mandatory at major events after a 5,000-person outdoor rave where almost no one wore masks or practiced social distancing. Spectators were allowed back into soccer stadiums, but with a seating limit of 5,000 fans and social distancing between parties. However, the limit on gatherings technically remains below 10 people. On July 8, the French government revealed it was preparing for a possible surge in the coming months but ruled out another nationwide lockdown, citing that the "economic and human consequences from a total lockdown are disastrous." Two weeks after reopening its borders, France has revised its travel corridor list, and is now banning travellers from Algeria due to a resurgence in that country.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With almost all businesses now reopened, the number of active cases is still increasing in France, now standing at 60,007. On July 6, the Louvre Museum reopened after a 16-week shutdown, with visitor numbers capped at 500 per half-hour--along with a compulsory face mask rule. The French Open has been confirmed to start on September 27, with 40% fewer spectators than usual. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe resigned on July 3. President Emmanuel Macron named the less well-known Jean Castex, who coordinated France's COVID reopening strategy, as the country's new prime minister. France's gradual reopening plan has been seen as generally successful so far by the public.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although the number of active cases in France continues to increase, the government uses both the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions as metrics for reopening--and these two measures are decreasing. On June 22, France officially entered Phase 3 of reopening. Most notably, schools have reopened for students under the age of 16 with compulsory attendance enforced. Physical distancing rules in classrooms have been relaxed and the 4m space requirement per pupil has been scrapped, along with the 15-pupil limit on class sizes. The usual pre-COVID-19 rules for schooling have resumed, even though summer vacation begins in two weeks. Cinemas reopened with spacing between audience members and face coverings. Demonstrations of 5,000 people or less will be allowed again, as long as protestors adhere to physical distancing and hygiene guidelines; social gatherings are limited to ten people in public places. Wearing a mask is compulsory on all public transport in France. France’s COVID-tracing app has failed to take off, with only 68 people using it to register a positive test result in the three weeks since its launch, despite hundreds of confirmed cases in just the last few days. Even though two million people (3% of population) downloaded it, roughly 500,000 users have uninstalled the app.As part of the ongoing parliamentary commission of inquiry, a public health expert testified that the government's scientific advisory body failed to make decisions based on science, and did not make COVID-19 tests widely available earlier in the crisis.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">COVID-19 fatalities and hospitalizations decreased in France this week, but the number of active cases increased with confirmed cases outpacing recoveries. Nevertheless on June 15, President Emmanuel Macron announced that all of mainland France is now in the so-called "green zone," including the Paris region. Accordingly, cafés and restaurants in Paris were allowed to reopen on June 15, along with some cultural institutions such as the Versailles Palace. On June 15, France's border with other EU states reopened while borders with countries outside the bloc "where the epidemic has been controlled" will reopen on July 1. Only travelers from Spain and the UK are required to self-isolate for two weeks, in parallel with current regulations in those two countries. The contact tracing app in France may not be able to connect with others across the EU because it stores data centrally; moreover, only 2% of the population (1.5 million people) has downloaded and activated the app, which was launched on June 2. Most surprisingly, Macron announced that every preschooler and pupil under the age of 16 will be required to go back to school on June 22 in mainland France. On June 16, a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the government's response to the COVID crisis was opened. This inquiry has extensive powers of investigation, where its summons are legally compulsory, its hearings are held under oath, and its members can carry out document checks for the next six months.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of hospitalizations continues decreasing this week, with 11,678 patients requiring medical attention. On June 9, for the first time since March 19, the number of people in intensive care fell below 1,000, standing at 933 as of June 11. In the “orange zone”, which is solely the Paris area, most secondary colleges/lycées have remained shut. On June 25, the iconic Eiffel Tower is set to open, with a limited capacity and no elevators. This week, the government announced that it will end its special powers to restrict civil liberties by decree without parliamentary approval brought in to deal with the pandemic on July 10, though it will retain the ability to curb gatherings and freedom of movement for four months. Furthermore, the government announced €15 billion (around 22.7 billion CAD) in rescue money for the pandemic-battered aerospace industry, in hopes of saving its hundreds of thousands of jobs and keeping plane maker Airbus and national airline Air France globally competitive. In exchange for aid, however, companies will be required to invest more and more rapidly in electric, hydrogen or other lower-emission aircrafts, since France aims to make its aviation industry the cleanest in the world.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">With hospitalizations and ICU occupancy decreasing steadily, France entered phase 2 of reopening on June 2. The Paris region remains the only one designated "orange," while the rest of the country is in the green zone, meaning that the rate of infection is low with minimal active circulation. As of June 2, bars, restaurants and cafes opened across the country with 1 meter distance between tables, however, in Paris only terraces remain open. Middle and high schools, along with parks and gardens, have also been permitted to reopen this week. As of Tuesday June 9 in green zones and on June 22 in Paris, swimming pools, gyms, amusement parks, theatres and concert halls will reopen. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain off-limits, and the government's StopCovid tracing app is functioning to tell users when they have been in close contact with a COVID+ patient. The next significant day for reopening in France is June 15, when the country will reopen its borders to tourists within the European Union without a quarantine. While non-EU travelers are not permitted to enter the country at all, travelers from the UK can enter, but will still be subject to a 14-day quarantine. 20,000 people attended a protest in Paris on June 2 in response to the 2016 death of 24-year-old Adama Traoré in police custody, and increased tensions between visible minorities and police during lockdown.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France's COVID-19 death toll remained less than 100 for the seventh in a row on May 27th. As well, ICU patients dropped by 54 to 1,555, continuing the downward trend, which is a key indicator for the government to continue reopening its economy. After reopening schools in mid-May, more than 50 have closed due to new COVID-19 outbreaks. There must be no more than 15 children in a class, no shared toys, and timed arrivals at school, and students over the age of 11 must wear masks. Although most primary schools have reopened, only one in five primary school students have returned to class since it is not yet compulsory for parents to send their children back to school. The government is encouraging the population to download a tracking app called StopCovid, which uses Bluetooth to trace when a phone is in proximity to others who have contracted the virus, without geolocating users. On May 28th, the PM announced that bars, restaurants, cafés, parks, and beaches could reopen with restrictions from June 2nd. Paris is now deemed an “orange” zone, allowing the region to loosen some restrictions on gatherings. Junior high schools and high schools will be able to reopen “faster than expected.” Finally, the country will welcome European tourists as of June 15th. The PM said that restrictions would be reintroduced if there are more than 50 daily cases for seven consecutive days in a region.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Hospitalisations in France continue to fall, which is the benchmark the Government is using to continue reopening the economy. Based on mathematical models, top health experts are not expecting a second wave anytime soon. Nonetheless, the Government has yet to firmly decide when borders, hotels, restaurants, and cafes will fully reopen. Last week PM Phillippe announced a €18 billion rescue plan for the tourism sector, with businesses up to 20 employees being able to access grants up to €10,000. As the lockdown is lifted and the weather is clearing up, the country has reported a 44% increase in the use of bicycles as a mode of transportation. A few days after reopening schools, a worrying flareup of about 70 cases was linked to this policy measure. Affected schools are being closed immediately, mostly in northern France and Paris. According to the original reopening plan announced on April 28th, on June 2nd cafes, restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres, and big museums, including the Louvre, will reopen. However, PM Phillippe announced this week that this is not guaranteed, and he will announce confirmed reopenings on May 25th. Although gatherings of more than 10 people are banned, infamous Yellow Vest protests began on May 16th, the first weekend after confinement restrictions were eased. Police broke up gatherings ranging from 50 to 350 protestors in  Bordeaux,  Paris,  Lyon, and Montpellier.</p>
