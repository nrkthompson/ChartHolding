  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p>As of June 26, all health regions in Ontario, except for portions of Windsor-Essex, are now at phase 2 of the government's reopening plan. In this phase, restaurants and bars can reopen for outdoor service, along with barbers, hair and nail salons, and child care centres. Gatherings of up to ten people are permitted, within social circles. Some municipalities are preparing to run summer camps throughout the province, which are due to begin around July. After two weeks in phase 2, a nail salon in Kingston experienced an outbreak, requiring all clients who visited the salon between June 12 and 24 to self-isolate. Premier Doug Ford has cautioned against enacting mandatory face mask laws, saying that it should be at each municipality's discretion as advised by the Chief Medical Officer.</p>
