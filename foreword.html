        Canada, like many countries around the world, is beginning to reopen its economy. At the same time, we are still confronting a serious public health threat in the SARS-CoV-2 virus and in COVID-19. 
      </p>
      <p>
        How are we reopening, compared to other countries? And how are we doing as a country at maintaining social distancing and the public support and attention necessary to sustain the fight against COVID-19? 
      </p>
      <p>
        On our Dashboard, we present unique quantitative data on: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The openness of the economy on nine different dimensions in 44 different jurisdictions: 34 OECD countries, 5 US states, and 5 Canadian provinces.</li>
        <li>Trends in social distancing in Canada.</li>
        <li>Trends in social media attention to COVID-19 and selected other topics.</li>
        <li>Trends in support for federal, provincial, and local government management of COVID-19.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We also provide a weekly qualitative summary of the actions governments are taking and considering taking to reopen their economies and manage the coronavirus.
