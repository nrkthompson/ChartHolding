        Canada, like many countries around the world, is beginning to reopen its economy. At the same time, we are still confronting a serious public health threat in the SARS-Co-V2 virus and in COVID-19. 
      </p>
      <p>
        How are we reopening, compared to other countries? And how are we doing as a country at maintaining social distancing and the public support and attention necessary to sustain the fight against COVID-19? 
      </p>
      <p>
        On our Dashboard, we present unique quantitative data on: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The openness of the economy on nine different dimensions in 36 different countries and states.</li>
        <li>Trends in social distancing in Canada.</li>
        <li>Trends in social media attention to social distancing.</li>
        <li>Trends in support for federal, provincial, and local government management of COVID-19.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We also provide a weekly qualitative summary of the actions governments are taking and considering taking to reopen their economics and manage the coronavirus. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our data are updated weekly. You can subscribe to a weekly update by clicking here.
