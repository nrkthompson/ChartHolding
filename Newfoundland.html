  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Newfoundland and Labrador remains at Alert Level 2. As schools reopen with COVID-19 checklists, parents are confused about what symptoms -- and how many -- would require a student to be kept home from school. Long telephone wait times to get guidance, along with difficulty booking a COVID-19 test, may result in parents avoiding reporting symptoms.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Travel restrictions imposed on non-residents who own property in PEI were lifted on August 31. Property owners may apply for an exemption with proof of ownership and will be required to isolate for 14 days after arrival. Effective September 9, isolation rules have been relaxed for rotational workers returning home from outside of the Atlantic bubble to improve mental health outcomes. Moving forward, workers can be tested on Day 5 of their isolation and can isolate for 7 days if the test is negative. Students are back to school in the province and the Newfoundland and Labrador Teachers’ Association is still concerned about varying rules between schools, masks not being mandatory for everyone, and large class sizes.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective August 24, non-medical masks will be mandatory for people older than 5 in indoor public spaces such as retail businesses, office buildings, and places of worship.  A recognized business or organization may now host up to 100 people inside a venue (up from 50 people)--as long as this is still less than 50% of the venue’s capacity. Organizers must record and keep a list of those in attendance for at least 2 weeks following an event. The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District presented its back to school plan with classes set to resume on September 9. Masks will only be mandatory for high school students on buses and in common areas. Each school will develop a plan that works best for the space and size of the school’s population. If a moderate or widespread outbreak occurs, schools will move to online learning. The Newfoundland Teachers Association has concerns related to classes of more than 30 students, the additional workload teachers will take on with extra supervision, and the planning required to keep up with health directives.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Newfoundland and Labrador remains at Alert Level 2. Parents and teachers are asking for greater clarity regarding mask requirements and class sizes before schools reopen in September. Specific details on school reopening have not been provided; many aspects of the plan are being left to the discretion of school boards. The opposition leader wants COVID-19 testing to be increased for travellers entering the province from outside the Atlantic bubble. He suggested the province look to different jurisdictions when creating their approach to travel and recommended requiring travellers to download the federal contact tracing app. He also called for an audit of how well the province is processing people at entry points and keeping track of them after arrival.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There are currently no active COVID-19 cases in Newfoundland and Labrador. The province has shifted away from the development of its own provincial contact tracing app and plans to use the federal app. People can download the app but cannot use it to report exposure yet; it could be up to a month before this functionality is ready. Andrew Furey was selected as the new premier designate. Newfoundland and Labrador’s COVID-19 travel ban has been challenged in court on the grounds that it violates the Charter and falls outside of provincial jurisdiction.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The province of Newfoundland and Labrador remains at Alert Level 2. The government and public health officials are considering whether or not to make masks mandatory in the province given the low rate of COVID-19 infections. Between May 4 and July 26, more than 12,000 travel exemptions were issued to people travelling to the province. On July 29, the last COVID-19 update was provided from the province’s outgoing premier; the new Liberal leader and premier-designate will be named on Monday.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health noted that  new cases have been on the rise across Canada this week, particularly among young people. She attributed the increase to social gatherings where public health guidelines are not being followed. At this time, the province is looking into whether to increase the current limit on public gatherings for weddings, funerals, and outdoor events to more than 50 people. Newfoundland and Labrador’s Teachers Association is criticizing the government’s decision to call teachers back a week early for orientation and training related to the new public health requirements for schools. The Teachers Association is concerned about the lack of consultation and a number of teachers are concerned about organizing childcare and vacation arrangements.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Visitor restrictions were loosened at healthcare facilities on July 14. Hospital patients and residents at long-term care and personal care homes are now permitted to select up to 6 visitors according to facility guidelines. The premier’s initial plans to allow non-essential Canadian travellers from outside Atlantic Canada to enter Newfoundland as early as July 17 (without a written exemption or 14-day quarantine) will not be going forward. The health minister said borders will not reopen to non-essential travellers from outside the Atlantic bubble until at least August.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Newfoundland and Labrador continues to be at Alert Level 2, with no detailed timeline for when the province will move to Alert Level 1. Alert Level 1 represents the new normal and a way to move forward until a vaccine for COVID-19 is available. On July 6, the government released a plan with three potential scenarios for reopening schools in September, dependent on the regional spread of COVID-19. School districts will determine which scenario to implement, in consultation with public health authorities in their region. The first scenario is that schools are open and instruction resumes in-class as normal with public health measures in place. The second involves schools being partially opened with the school’s population split up into alternating schedules. The last scenario is full time at-home learning, which may require teachers to be in school to support students with learning or behavioural disabilities. The return to school plan will include a COVID-19 assessment sheet that must be filled out each morning by parents or students asking about their travel history and any symptoms. The PC Education Critic and the NDP Education Critic said the plan lacked necessary details, and they were both highly critical of the burden placed on school districts to shift through the three scenarios.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Newfoundland and Labrador is at Alert Phase 2. Bars and nightclubs reopened, but dance floors remain prohibited and capacity is restricted. Despite this, overcrowding and dancing continues in many establishments. On July 4, historic sites will reopen with a one-way flow pattern for visitors with designated entry and exit doors where possible. Effective July 3, residents of Atlantic Canada can resume travel within the region without having to self-isolate for 14 days when arriving in another province. Visitors from outside the region will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and, once this period has passed, can travel within the Atlantic region. Premier Dwight Ball said that if the Atlantic bubble is successful it could be expanded to other provinces on July 17. However, many are concerned about whether the Atlantic bubble is in the best interest of the province. The government is being criticized for planning to allow non-essential travel despite the continued day-to-day restrictions.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Currently, Newfoundland and Labrador is at Alert phase 2 where retail stores, malls, spas, salons and tattoo parlours reopened. Outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people are permitted and the two-household bubble has been expanded to include an additional 6 people. New members of this extended bubble do not have to be from the same household. Places of worship may resume without public gathering restrictions. Campsites are open with limitations on overnight camping and outdoor pools. Large playgrounds, gyms, fitness facilities, indoor pools and performance spaces are open. Restaurants have reopened at a reduced capacity and buffets remain closed. Bars, lounges, cinemas, and theatres are open with reduced capacity. Distance learning continues, summer camps are operating, and daycare operations are being expanded. The province is lifting restrictions slowly compared to other provinces with similar epidemiological conditions. The government is struggling to maintain broad public support for COVID-19 restrictions. Effective July 3, an Atlantic bubble agreement was made to allow free movement between Atlantic provinces without self-isolation. The province plans to begin easing travel restrictions with other provinces on July 17.</p>
