  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Greece, cases are rising moderately, with 200-400 new daily cases in the last month. Over 50% of all new cases in the country are in the Attica region, which includes Athens. The government extended the current restrictions in Attica until October 12, which includes a curfew at restaurants and bars, a ban on gatherings larger than 9 people, and the mandatory use of masks indoors and outdoors. Other restrictions have been extended in some regions. Throughout the country, demonstrations are being organized by students, teachers, and parents in response to inadequate COVID-19 safety measures in schools. Demonstrators want the government to reduce class sizes, hire more teachers, and improve cleaning measures in schools. Confirmed cases in schools have resulted in the closure of 135 schools, and positive cases among young people increased by 30% in September.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Several COVID-19 related travel restrictions have been extended until October 12 regarding travel restrictions from certain countries, negative COVID-19 tests, and passenger location forms. Passengers arriving in Greece from Poland, Belgium, Spain, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the UAE, Malta, Albania, and North Macedonia, must present a negative test upon arrival. Also, flights remain suspended between Greece and Turkey, and Greece and the Catalonia region in Spain. As cases continue to rise in Athens, additional measures have been introduced, including additional testing centres, more rapid testing in hot spots, and the creation of temporary isolation facilities for the city’s vulnerable groups. The first cruise ship visited Greece since March has had a COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in more than 1,500 people isolating onboard after crew members tested positive.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective September 28, passengers arriving in Greece from the Czech Republic must provide a negative COVID-19 test result which is not older than 72 hours.In Athens, COVID-19 restrictions are in place until October 4. Measures include a limit of 9 people for social gatherings, 40% of all employees working from home, and people 65+ only being in contact with their immediate family members. On September 24, hospital doctors went on strike for 24 hours to protest staffing shortages and a lack of necessary infrastructure in ICUs.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Greece, students returned to school on September 14 with several new measures in place. Students and staff must wear masks indoors at all times and outdoors when physical distancing is not possible. A majority of new cases in Greece are within the Greater Athens Area, prompting the Health Minister to discuss the governmentís plans to introduce additional restrictions on specific municipalities if needed to control the spread. Effective September 16, masks are mandatory in the Greater Athens Area in all closed work spaces and in open areas where 1.5 metres distance cannot be maintained. The operation of live music establishments has been suspended for 14 days and restaurants can only seat 6 people per table. Cinemas and theatres will now only be permitted to operate at 60% capacity.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 14, schools reopen for students, with all students and teachers required to wear masks both indoors and outdoors while on school premises. Un-masked demonstrators gathered in cities across Greece to protest mandatory face mask rules in schools. Doctors and opposition MPs are accusing the government of inaccurately reporting the number of COVID-19 cases in order to maintain tourism. The Minister for Civil Protection admitted that only regional data about infection rates was given so that specific holiday destinations did not receive negative publicity.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New localized restrictions have been imposed on several regions in Greece, including  Mykonos, Crete, and Corfu, in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19. Wearing a mask will be mandatory in public, both indoors and outdoors. Festivities, markets, and religious ceremonies have been prohibited and restaurants can only seat a maximum of 4 people per table. On August 21, the government announced its plan to provide a vaccine free to all Greek citizens once it becomes available. Face masks will also be made available for all students and staff when schools reopen in September--following criticism by opposition parties and parent organizations. Local authorities will be given a grant of 15.2 million euros to cover the cost of masks to ensure that all students, regardless of their family income, have access. The use of masks will only be made mandatory in the classroom, not outdoors, in the gym, or during breaks.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Greek government announced several new measures that will be in effect until August 24. A night time curfew from midnight to 7 am has been imposed for bars, restaurants, and cafes in Athens and the islands. Public events where people are standing customers in bars, nightclubs, or concerts are banned until August 31. All processions and rural trade fairs have been suspended indefinitely. There will be a 50-person limit on all public gatherings except where protection measures are in place--such as in restaurants and theatres. All passengers travelling to Greece from Bulgaria, Malta, Romania, and the United Arab Emirates will be obliged to provide a negative test on arrival to Greece, taken no more than 72 hours prior. Negative tests will also be required for passengers arriving from Albania, Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Spain, and Sweden. The government has extended its ban on the entry of non-EU citizens to Greece with some exceptions--including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Greek scientists are warning that the country may be entering a second wave after a rise in cases, especially among young people.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the number of domestic infections continues to rise, the government is urging citizens to strictly adhere to current rules in order to avoid new restrictions in August. The adoption of new restrictive measures would be harmful to Greeceís economy and could put its crucial tourism season at risk. Effective August 4 to 18, masks will be mandatory on ferry decks, extending the requirement beyond indoor public spaces. Beginning August 6, Cyprus said it will begin testing arrivals from Greece.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Several new restrictions came into effect in Greece on July 28, including an expanded list of indoor public spaces that require masks. The list now includes retail shops, public service offices, banks, food stores, bakeries, and elevators. Masks are not required at churches. Passengers arriving in Greece from Bulgaria and Romania will be required to have proof of a negative test result from within 72 hours prior to entering the country. This is not required for Greek citizens or permanent residents, or for essential professional travellers.  Effective August 1, Greece will allow cruise ships to dock--but only if passengers can present evidence of a negative test in the previous 72 hours. Six cruise ports will be open and random testing will be conducted by Greek authorities.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Several restrictive measures have been taken in response to the recent increase in cases in Greece. The Greek government has banned flights to and from Turkey and is only permitting flights from Albania and North Macedonia to land at Athens' International Airport until July 31. From July 28 to August 4, visitors arriving by air from Bulgaria and Romania will be required to provide a negative test result taken in the last 72 hours before their arrival. Effective July 22, essential movement is only permitted through specific check-points, and those with a residence permit must complete a Passenger Locator Form. Seasonal workers who leave Greece before August 4 will be unable to return to the country after being determined as a potential source of the increased spread. The use of face masks or coverings is once again mandatory for all supermarket employees and customers. Greek officials have linked the rise in cases to international travel and variation in the implementation of health regulations across regions. However, the government still plans to allow more tourists from other countries to travel to Greece on July 31.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Greek authorities are considering a reintroduction of COVID-19 restrictions following a rise in cases throughout the country. These measures may include a limit of 6 people per table at restaurants and bars, and the use of masks in specific public areas. Social distancing regulations and capacity limits at beaches have been extended until July 31, with inspections in place to monitor compliance. On July 13, the government announced that a ban on festivals will continue until the end of July. Testing will intensify and be extended to seasonal workers from neighbouring countries at land border crossings with Bulgaria and Albania. Border officials will begin checking the authenticity of negative test results presented by travellers. All travellers crossing land borders are required to present negative test results from the past 72 hours. Direct flights from the UK have resumed and the Greek government will allow for the resumption of direct flights from Sweden on July 22. In response to the rise in cases, the PM is requesting that COVID-19 health and safety measures be strictly enforced to prevent any further outbreaks.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After weeks without new cases, Greece has recorded a number of positive tests. A majority of cases are related to tourists entering the country and arrivals through northern land borders. Health authorities are concerned after more than 100 tourists tested positive and entered quarantine since Greece reopened to international visitors on July 1. Regardless, Greece has further eased restrictions intended to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Rules permitting a maximum of 6 customers per table at bars and restaurants have been removed and the use of masks inside shopping malls will no longer be mandatory. A government spokesperson said that they were aware that restarting tourism would result in a rise in cases, but they are focused on quickly locating and isolating the cases to prevent further spread. Effective July 6, the Greek government announced the temporary closure of its borders to Serbian citizens due to a rise of COVID-19 cases in that country. The government has banned all but essential travel from Serbia and closed all entry points for a week. Greece is going against the EU Councilís recommendation, as Serbia is on their list of 15 safe non-EU countries whose citizens are allowed to enter the EU. Effective July 14, Greece will only allow visitors through its land border crossing with Bulgaria if they show a negative COVID-19 test.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 1, international flights can now arrive at any airport in Greece from other EU member countries and a select group of non-EU countries. However, direct flights from Sweden, Turkey, Russia, and the UK are banned until July 15. Previously, regional airports were not open to international flights. International ports are also open to tourists. Greece will renew the list of countries whose citizens can enter based on guidelines from the EU every two weeks. In order to enter the country, all travellers must fill out a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) 48 hours before departure--explaining where they came from and where they will be staying on arrival.  Also, travellers are subject to random testing upon entry into Greece. Greece reopened 7 of their 14 border crossings on July 1, and government authorities reopened a number of  highways which bring Balkan tourists to northern parts of the country.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Until June 30, all travellers arriving at Greeceís two main airports are subject to either compulsory or random testing based on their travel origin, as set by EASA guidelines. Effective July 1, direct flights between international destinations and the Greek islands will resume. On June 21, lockdown restrictions were imposed on a northwestern town, ordering schools to close in order to contain the infection after seven people tested positive for COVID-19. The Greek government announced an extension of the lockdown on its migrant camps in the Aegean Islands until July 5. The lockdown was supposed to end on June 22 as the country prepared for the tourist season but this has been extended since initially being introduced on March 21. 2,000 people protested in central Athens to denounce the governmentís treatment of migrants.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Tourism season officially began in Greece on June 15 with seasonal hotels, museums, historic buildings, and entertainment parks opening to visitors. Also, international flights will resume to Athens and Thessaloniki airports. Travellers arriving from airports deemed high risk by the EASA will be tested upon arrival and could face quarantines, however, for other travellers there are no requirements and they may only be subject to random testing. Direct flights between international destinations and the islands will not resume until July 1, along with direct flights between the US and Greece. The government is implementing several measures which include testing facilities on the islands, designated doctors for each hotel and quarantine zones for those who test positive. An increase in the number of cases among several municipalities has led authorities to impose a curfew and restrictions on gatherings and  travel.  Since Greece has opened its doors to international visitors, resurgence is a concern and authorities are implementing strict measures to avoid outbreaks in cities or tourist areas where there may be crowds. The prime minister said Greece will be prepared in the event of a second wave because of social distancing, protective measures and additional ICU hospital beds.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Greek Health Ministry has announced 97 new cases since June 5, during which they experienced the largest daily increase since April 23, with 52 new cases in 24 hours. In response, on June 9 the government announced they would increase testing and ensure compliance with protection measures as well as introduce restrictions locally where clusters of new infections have been reported over the past few days. Of the 97 new cases, 30 involved travellers from abroad. June 15 marks the beginning of the tourist season with flights to the Athens and Thessaloniki airports set to resume. Arrivals from EASA airports will be subject to testing and quarantine. On July 1, flights to all Greek airports and sea arrivals from all countries will resume. Tourists will be subject to random testing. Regardless of Greece's plan to maintain strict hygiene protocols in hotels and businesses, it is uncertain how many airlines will be flying to the country or if people are willing to partake in non-essential travel.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 1, primary schools and kindergartens, open-air cinemas, year-round hotels and pools reopened. The decision to send younger students back to school faced criticism from parents, despite the number of confirmed cases declining to 49 this week. Campsites, wedding receptions, and tattoo parlours also reopened. The Greek government outlined a two-part plan for tourism. On June 15, visitors can fly into Athens and Thessaloniki, the two major airports. On July 1, direct international flights to regional airports, including on islands will be permitted. An initial decision that was made would only allow citizens from 29 countries to enter Greece, but this triggered some international backlash, including from the UK and Italy who had not been included on the permitted travel nationalities list. The government has since clarified that the measures refer to flights originating from specific airports, rather than countries, and are based on the EASA list of airports with high risks of transmission. Tourists arriving from airports listed on the EASA will be tested and remain at a designated hotel for one day. If the test is negative, visitors are then obliged to observe a 7 day quarantine and if positive, remain at the hotel for health monitoring and a 14 day quarantine. Authorities will conduct random sample testing on passengers arriving from airports on the approved list and not on the EASA list of airports with high risks of transmission.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of May 25, Greece entered phase 4 of it's unlocking strategy, easing restrictions related to tourism, restaurants, shopping centres, and ferry services. Effective June 1, indoor shopping centres can reopen, and restaurants can reopen with outdoor seating only. Ferry services have resumed to all Greek islands and mainland ports for travellers but not yet to foreign tourists. Passenger ferries will operate at 50% capacity with strict physical distancing measures and health and safety protocols in place. On June 1, year-round hotels will reopen with seasonal hotels to follow on June 15, the same day some direct international flights from Athens International Airport will resume. However, many direct international flights will not resume until July 1. Greece will allow between 20-25 countries to visit without quarantine. Currently, citizens from all EU countries except Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands can fly into Athens but are subject to a 14 day quarantine. Visits from Britain and other non-EU countries are currently restricted, including Canada and the United States.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Greece entered the third phase of their reopening plan on May 18, reopening malls, some schools, archeological sites, and beaches. Primary schools and kindergartens remain closed, but middle schools and high schools will operate by dividing classes into two groups and alternating the groups on different days. Other measures include having a maximum of 15 students per classroom, optional face masks, and the cleaning and disinfection of school facilities twice a day. Online learning will be provided for students who are unable to attend classes and for the days students are not in school. Greeceís tourism sector is set to begin reopening by June 15, starting with the reopening of seasonal hotels. Greece reopened 500 public beaches under strict physical distancing measures that include guidelines for the number of beachgoers and distances between beach umbrellas and sunbeds. A mandatory 14 day quarantine for incoming visitors and returning residents has been extended until the end of May. Free travel between regions on the mainland and to the island of Crete will resume, and sea travel will be allowed with boats filled to 50% capacity. While airports are reopening to international traffic later this month, it is unclear when direct flights to the main tourist islands will resume. The government has announced their plan to offer sample tests to incoming tourists but, not whether these will be available to all.</p>
