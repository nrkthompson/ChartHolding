  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s 7-day moving average of new cases is 10,230, which is a record for the country during the pandemic. France uses hospitalization and ICU capacity as metrics to help with their reopening and closing policies. Over the past 7 days, there were 3,223 more hospitalisations -- of which 535 were intensive care admissions. Across the country, 50 departments are now above the alert threshold of 50 new cases per 100,000 people.  Every department has reached the threshold of “vigilance”, meaning there have been more than 10 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past seven days. Infections are particularly high among young people, prompting the government to mandate face masks outdoors and in workplaces. The government also pledged to boost COVID-19 tests, reinforce control of self-isolation conditions, and impose stricter rules in high risk zones -- but it has ruled out a new nationwide lockdown. Instead, France's major southern cities of Bordeaux, Marseille and Nice -- classified as red zones -- have banned public gatherings of 10 people in parks and beaches and have reduced the public-event attendance capacities to 1,000 people from the previous 5,000 person limit. People are urged to limit visits to nursing homes and not to eat and drink in bars while standing.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s daily new COVID-19 cases rose by more than 8,500 for the third time in six days on September 9. The disease is spreading at its fastest pace since it emerged in the country. France uses hospitalization and ICU capacity as metrics to help with their reopening and lockdown policies. The number of people hospitalized has reached a one-month high of 5,003, with ICU capacity mimicking levels seen at the end of June (600). However, the current metrics remain well below what was seen during the peak in April -- largely due to the recent increase in cases involving younger people. As of September 9, the government has yet to take additional steps to counter the high infection rates, but the country’s scientific council warned that they would have to take multiple unpopular decisions within days. They indicated that they are two weeks away from Spain’s situation, and the fact that new cases had not yet swamped the health system might have created "a false sense of security." The council will consider the possibility of introducing local lockdowns, especially in hard-hit areas like Marseille. On September 1, around 12 million students returned to school. If a school reports more than three COVID-19 cases, then it will temporarily close; out of 60,000 schools across the country, 22 have closed within the first week.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">For the first time since the two-month lockdown ended in May, France reported more than 4,500 cases on August 23. The nation’s seven-day moving average of new cases increased by one thousand since last week, now standing at 3,481. Health Minister Olivier Véran said infections were four times higher in the 20 to 40 age group than the rest of the population--the result of summer parties. Veran has ruled out another nationwide lockdown because all other metrics (namely hospitalizations, ICU capacity and deaths) are generally stable. The application of masks has been made compulsory in the workplace as of September 1, after a quarter of COVID-19 clusters were discovered to have originated in the workplace. Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said that students in secondary and high schools must wear a mask--regardless of distancing measures. In September, in-person schooling will be compulsory for all.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s seven-day moving average of new cases now stands at 2,364 after the weekend of August 15-17, which saw the country add 10,000 cases. Paris and Marseille have both been declared COVID-19 “red zones,” meaning that the virus is actively and rapidly circulating among inhabitants. However, hospitalizations and ICU admission levels remain relatively stable in part because younger people--who have experienced bigger increases in infection compared to older individuals--are less likely to develop complications from the virus. The government is set to propose the introduction of compulsory masks in shared workspaces later this week and Paris authorities have expanded their list of outdoor spaces/streets where mask wearing is mandatory. France is deploying riot police to enforce masks after violence broke out last week. Due to the recent surge, the United Kingdom has enforced a two-week quarantine requirement for people coming from France starting August 15.  France is set to apply reciprocal measures this week. France will release more details regarding school reopening this week.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s seven-day moving average of new cases--now standing at 1,351--has risen in the last week by almost 50 percent. Despite the surge in new cases, the number of people hospitalized for the disease continues to go down, by 88 to 5,060--extending a 10-week-long trend. Because of the increase in cases, wearing a face mask in busy outdoor parts of Paris (river banks, Champs-Elysee Avenue, markets, parks, etc.) is mandatory as of August 10. Executives from Air France-KLM and Lufthansa Group have called on the Canadian government to remove travel restrictions on EU nationals. As the epidemiological situation of France worsens, executives in the tourism industry worry that countries (even within the EU) will add France to their quarantine list.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France reported 3,376 new COVID-19 cases over the first weekend of August. The number of people being treated in ICUs for the disease has increased for the first time since April. Many experts acknowledge that France is experiencing a resurgence, which has been attributed to various bars that opened in mid-July. Although mask wearing became mandatory in all indoor public places across the nation last month, rules on wearing masks outdoors in the hardest-hit parts of France (Lille and Nice) took effect on August 3. Pressure is growing on the government to mandate the use of masks outdoors nationwide. Although the government does not want to resort to another nationwide lockdown, it has yet to close any regions with outbreaks.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France’s daily coronavirus infection rate is on the rise again. More than 1,130 new cases were reported on July 24, making July's figures similar to those seen in May. The nation’s R-rate has risen to 1.3 from 1.2 last week. Although the country is preparing for a second wave, no closure policies have been reinforced yet. As of last week, people in France must wear face masks in all indoor establishments, and working from home is still recommended. Jean Castex, the French Prime Minister, is urging the French not to travel to Catalonia, especially Barcelona, due to an active outbreak there. France announced mandatory testing for any arrivals from 16 countries, including the US.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the number of active cases continues to increase in France, the nation’s R rate has risen to 1.2. The Brittany region’s R rate rose from 0.92 to 2.62 in just five days. President Macron—who had previously announced that face masks would become obligatory on August 1—moved up the date to July 20 following concerns over “slight signs” of resurgence. Wearing a mask will now be mandatory in public establishments, with a 135-euro fine for non-compliance. On July 15 Disneyland Paris partially reopened, as did the top floor of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">French officials warned that the R-rate is now above 1.0; 71 clusters of outbreaks are being investigated and contacts traced. Sewage testing indicates that traces of COVID-19 in Parisian non-drinking water over the past 14 days have increased. Professor Jean François Delfraissy, head of the government’s scientific advisory body, noted that "barrier gestures" that prevent the spread of COVID-19 are being “abandoned” in France--as even ministers in the new cabinet exchanged kisses and hugs during their swearing-in ceremonies. The municipality of Nice is considering making wearing masks mandatory at major events after a 5,000-person outdoor rave where almost no one wore masks or practiced social distancing. Spectators were allowed back into soccer stadiums, but with a seating limit of 5,000 fans and social distancing between parties. However, the limit on gatherings technically remains below 10 people. On July 8, the French government revealed it was preparing for a possible surge in the coming months but ruled out another nationwide lockdown, citing that the "economic and human consequences from a total lockdown are disastrous." Two weeks after reopening its borders, France has revised its travel corridor list, and is now banning travellers from Algeria due to a resurgence in that country.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With almost all businesses now reopened, the number of active cases is still increasing in France, now standing at 60,007. On July 6, the Louvre Museum reopened after a 16-week shutdown, with visitor numbers capped at 500 per half-hour--along with a compulsory face mask rule. The French Open has been confirmed to start on September 27, with 40% fewer spectators than usual. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe resigned on July 3. President Emmanuel Macron named the less well-known Jean Castex, who coordinated France's COVID reopening strategy, as the country's new prime minister. France's gradual reopening plan has been seen as generally successful so far by the public.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although the number of active cases in France continues to increase, the government uses both the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions as metrics for reopening--and these two measures are decreasing. On June 22, France officially entered Phase 3 of reopening. Most notably, schools have reopened for students under the age of 16 with compulsory attendance enforced. Physical distancing rules in classrooms have been relaxed and the 4m space requirement per pupil has been scrapped, along with the 15-pupil limit on class sizes. The usual pre-COVID-19 rules for schooling have resumed, even though summer vacation begins in two weeks. Cinemas reopened with spacing between audience members and face coverings. Demonstrations of 5,000 people or less will be allowed again, as long as protestors adhere to physical distancing and hygiene guidelines; social gatherings are limited to ten people in public places. Wearing a mask is compulsory on all public transport in France. France’s COVID-tracing app has failed to take off, with only 68 people using it to register a positive test result in the three weeks since its launch, despite hundreds of confirmed cases in just the last few days. Even though two million people (3% of population) downloaded it, roughly 500,000 users have uninstalled the app.As part of the ongoing parliamentary commission of inquiry, a public health expert testified that the government's scientific advisory body failed to make decisions based on science, and did not make COVID-19 tests widely available earlier in the crisis.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">COVID-19 fatalities and hospitalizations decreased in France this week, but the number of active cases increased with confirmed cases outpacing recoveries. Nevertheless on June 15, President Emmanuel Macron announced that all of mainland France is now in the so-called "green zone," including the Paris region. Accordingly, cafés and restaurants in Paris were allowed to reopen on June 15, along with some cultural institutions such as the Versailles Palace. On June 15, France's border with other EU states reopened while borders with countries outside the bloc "where the epidemic has been controlled" will reopen on July 1. Only travelers from Spain and the UK are required to self-isolate for two weeks, in parallel with current regulations in those two countries. The contact tracing app in France may not be able to connect with others across the EU because it stores data centrally; moreover, only 2% of the population (1.5 million people) has downloaded and activated the app, which was launched on June 2. Most surprisingly, Macron announced that every preschooler and pupil under the age of 16 will be required to go back to school on June 22 in mainland France. On June 16, a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the government's response to the COVID crisis was opened. This inquiry has extensive powers of investigation, where its summons are legally compulsory, its hearings are held under oath, and its members can carry out document checks for the next six months.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of hospitalizations continues decreasing this week, with 11,678 patients requiring medical attention. On June 9, for the first time since March 19, the number of people in intensive care fell below 1,000, standing at 933 as of June 11. In the “orange zone”, which is solely the Paris area, most secondary colleges/lycées have remained shut. On June 25, the iconic Eiffel Tower is set to open, with a limited capacity and no elevators. This week, the government announced that it will end its special powers to restrict civil liberties by decree without parliamentary approval brought in to deal with the pandemic on July 10, though it will retain the ability to curb gatherings and freedom of movement for four months. Furthermore, the government announced €15 billion (around 22.7 billion CAD) in rescue money for the pandemic-battered aerospace industry, in hopes of saving its hundreds of thousands of jobs and keeping plane maker Airbus and national airline Air France globally competitive. In exchange for aid, however, companies will be required to invest more and more rapidly in electric, hydrogen or other lower-emission aircrafts, since France aims to make its aviation industry the cleanest in the world.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With hospitalizations and ICU occupancy decreasing steadily, France entered phase 2 of reopening on June 2. The Paris region remains the only one designated "orange," while the rest of the country is in the green zone, meaning that the rate of infection is low with minimal active circulation. As of June 2, bars, restaurants and cafes opened across the country with 1 meter distance between tables, however, in Paris only terraces remain open. Middle and high schools, along with parks and gardens, have also been permitted to reopen this week. As of Tuesday June 9 in green zones and on June 22 in Paris, swimming pools, gyms, amusement parks, theatres and concert halls will reopen. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain off-limits, and the government's StopCovid tracing app is functioning to tell users when they have been in close contact with a COVID+ patient. The next significant day for reopening in France is June 15, when the country will reopen its borders to tourists within the European Union without a quarantine. While non-EU travelers are not permitted to enter the country at all, travelers from the UK can enter, but will still be subject to a 14-day quarantine. 20,000 people attended a protest in Paris on June 2 in response to the 2016 death of 24-year-old Adama Traoré in police custody, and increased tensions between visible minorities and police during lockdown.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">France's COVID-19 death toll remained less than 100 for the seventh in a row on May 27th. As well, ICU patients dropped by 54 to 1,555, continuing the downward trend, which is a key indicator for the government to continue reopening its economy. After reopening schools in mid-May, more than 50 have closed due to new COVID-19 outbreaks. There must be no more than 15 children in a class, no shared toys, and timed arrivals at school, and students over the age of 11 must wear masks. Although most primary schools have reopened, only one in five primary school students have returned to class since it is not yet compulsory for parents to send their children back to school. The government is encouraging the population to download a tracking app called StopCovid, which uses Bluetooth to trace when a phone is in proximity to others who have contracted the virus, without geolocating users. On May 28th, the PM announced that bars, restaurants, cafés, parks, and beaches could reopen with restrictions from June 2nd. Paris is now deemed an “orange” zone, allowing the region to loosen some restrictions on gatherings. Junior high schools and high schools will be able to reopen “faster than expected.” Finally, the country will welcome European tourists as of June 15th. The PM said that restrictions would be reintroduced if there are more than 50 daily cases for seven consecutive days in a region.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Hospitalisations in France continue to fall, which is the benchmark the Government is using to continue reopening the economy. Based on mathematical models, top health experts are not expecting a second wave anytime soon. Nonetheless, the Government has yet to firmly decide when borders, hotels, restaurants, and cafes will fully reopen. Last week PM Phillippe announced a €18 billion rescue plan for the tourism sector, with businesses up to 20 employees being able to access grants up to €10,000. As the lockdown is lifted and the weather is clearing up, the country has reported a 44% increase in the use of bicycles as a mode of transportation. A few days after reopening schools, a worrying flareup of about 70 cases was linked to this policy measure. Affected schools are being closed immediately, mostly in northern France and Paris. According to the original reopening plan announced on April 28th, on June 2nd cafes, restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres, and big museums, including the Louvre, will reopen. However, PM Phillippe announced this week that this is not guaranteed, and he will announce confirmed reopenings on May 25th. Although gatherings of more than 10 people are banned, infamous Yellow Vest protests began on May 16th, the first weekend after confinement restrictions were eased. Police broke up gatherings ranging from 50 to 350 protestors in  Bordeaux,  Paris,  Lyon, and Montpellier.</p>
