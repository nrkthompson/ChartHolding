      South Korea has experienced a major spike in COVID-19 infections over the past weeks, with more than 250 new cases related to nightclubs confirmed as of May 27. Widespread testing is being conducted among those who are known to have recently visited the venues connected to this resurgence. New testing kits with the potential to produce the results within 1 hour are undergoing review before their widespread use is approved. Kindergarten students, primary school students in grades 1-2, and middle school students in grades 9 and 11 resumed in-person classes on May 27 with strict preventative measures rules and flexible scheduling in place. Some schools have chosen to postpone their reopening. All other students are expected to resume in-person classes at the beginning of June. Professional sporting events have been permitted to resume without fans. Despite the warm weather creating difficulties with respect to wearing masks, it remains mandatory for people boarding public transport and flights. In order to cope with imported cases, South Korea is asking that long-term stayers acquire re-entry permits and physiological assessments arriving in the country.
