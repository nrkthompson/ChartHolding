      Having managed to maintain a limited level of new infections for two weeks, Japan saw more than 70 new per infections day on June 15 and 16. Tokyo continues to be the hotspot of new infections, with nightlife establishments being the most worrisome venues. A contact tracing app is planned to roll out next week. Effective June 12, amusement parks, game centers and internet cafes are allowed to reopen in Tokyo. Bars and restaurants can extend their operation hours from 10 pm to midnight. However, nightlife establishments have been required to enforce preventive guidelines such as physical distancing, installing acrylic boards and wearing masks. Keeping a customer record is also suggested. Starting June 19, restrictive measures will further relax nationwide. National restrictions on the operation of bars, Karaoke boxes, gyms and other businesses will be lifted. Events can accommodate a maximum of 1,000 people while indoor events must simultaneously comply with the 50% capacity limit. Professional sports could resume without spectators. Inter-prefectural travel will be completely restored. Japan is in the final stage of negotiating entry restrictions with Vietnam, while also holding consultations with Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. The limited easing, expected to take effect as early as late June, will first be accessible to Japanese businesspeople.
