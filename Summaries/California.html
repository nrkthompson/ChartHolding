  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 12, California passed 1 million COVID-19 cases. Over the past week, the state’s COVID-19 positivity rate increased to 4.2%.  This is the first time since September that the state’s positivity rate has exceeded 4%. Over the past two weeks, California had a 31% spike in hospitalizations. Eleven counties regressed in reopening. Sacramento, San Diego and Stanislaus joined LA in purple, which is stage one and prohibits indoor dining and in-person church, for example. No counties reopened further this week. Schools in Sacramento, San Diego and Stanislaus that are already in person may continue in person, but schools that have not already reopened must stay closed. Elementary schools may obtain a waiver from their county’s department of health to reopen in person. Museums have joined amusement parks, like Disney, in requests to reopen.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of November 4, California has seen a 13.5% increase in hospitalizations and a 20% increase in ICU patients over the previous two weeks. The state’s positivity rate also increased from 2.6% to 3.3% over the past two weeks. LA County also reported its highest daily number of cases since August, with no connection to the backlog of cases, and expects that the transmission rate is greater than 1.0. There has been a rise in northern California COVID-19 cases, so Shasta County regressed to purple and Plumas County regressed to orange on the government’s reopening indicators. Orange County will also be regressing to purple in response to the rise in cases and an outbreak at a long term care home. Nevada County may also regress from orange to red, which officials associate with COVID-19 fatigue. Colusa County is progressing from red to orange.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 27, California’s COVID-19 test positivity rate was 2.9%, new ICU admissions increased by 5.9% and hospitalizations increased by 4.7%. On October 29, the weekly average of COVID-19 deaths fell to its lowest point since April. On October 27, seven counties progressed in reopening; one county entered yellow, four entered orange and two entered red. On October 27, California’s governor refused a request to allow large amusement parks to reopen. According to recently released regulations, large theme parks can reopen at 25% in the yellow tier, meaning fewer than 1 new case daily per 100,000 people in the county and a weekly average of positive cases lower than 2%. Smaller theme parks with a capacity of up to 15,000 people, can reopen at 25% or with 500 visitors in the orange tier. Counties in the orange have fewer than 4 new daily cases per 100,000 people and a weekly positive COVID-19 test rate under 5%. Sacramento County schools are now permitted in person. A new PCR testing facility that opened in Valencia can process over 150,000 tests daily and at a faster processing rate than before.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 22, California reported 6,359 new cases; approximately 2000 cases were from Los Angeles, where there has been a testing backlog. The daily average of cases has increased by 5.5%, while the weekly average case rate has increased 15.1%. As of October 26, California had a cumulative total of cases greater than 906,000 cases, the most cases in any one US state. On October 20, San Francisco entered yellow or phase four, which is the most open. As of October 20, all personal care services will be allowed indoors with regulations at all phases, meaning that certain personal care services, like estheticians, spas and tattoo parlors, previously forced to close when counties were in phase one can now be open. Approximately 60% of elementary and secondary students live in counties that are permitted to reopen in-person learning and some schools have already done so. California presented guidelines for amusement parks like Disneyland to reopen, but interpretations of the rules suggest that the parks could be closed anywhere from weeks or a year.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 16, California reported 2,979 new cases; California’s total COVID-19 cases reached 864,455, with 16,899 deaths. The COVID-19 case trends in the state have been falling; the weekly death-average fell to 57, which is 6.3% fewer than last week and the daily average of new cases fell to 3,097, which is 7.1% fewer than last week. Sutter County progressed from purple to red or phase one to phase two, Placer, El Dorado, Santa Clara and Alameda counties progressed from red to orange or phase two to phase three. Approximately eight counties are classified as phase four, which occurs when the daily infection rate is lower than 1 per 100,000 residents. The governor said that to ensure stable economic recovery, unlike after the first wave, California would have to reopen more slowly. The governor did not provide industry specifics, but theme park companies are complaining about the lack of guidelines for them.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California’s average daily death count hit its lowest point over the past three months, suggesting an end to the wave of infections seen over the summer. The 7-day daily average reached 61, and the average deaths fell approximately 20% compared to last week and 28% compared to the two weeks prior. The reason behind this fall is connected to a decrease in deaths in Southern California and LA, which previously had accounted for approximately 40% of the state’s deaths. On October 9, the overall average of cases was 3300 cases per day.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 30, the governor enacted various bills that: prevent eviction and foreclosure, provide economic recovery packages, expand paid sick and family leave for front line workers and increase access to workers’ compensation. He also passed bills related to some of the governor’s executive actions taken as part of the pandemic response. California’s governor advocated for the HEROES act and encouraged White House and Senate officials to pass the bill that supports state, local, territorial and tribal governments and delivers economic relief to Americans.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 22, California health officials said that nine counties would progress into less restrictive reopening phases. The government’s criteria for reopening counties include testing numbers and whether counties adequately test in diverse communities. Nail salons are permitted to reopen across the state depending on compliance with the sector specific health directives. Several schools in Orange County have resumed in person schooling since Orange County is classified as red or phase 2 on the state’s new reopening guide.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the week of September 14, the positivity rate in California was 3.5% -- which is the lowest that it has been since March. In August, positivity rates were almost double the current rate. California is the first state to conduct 13 million COVID-19 tests. The governor says that the government will continue including the number of college students with COVID-19 in their count of active cases. The suggestion to exclude college students with COVID-19 from the count of active cases came as San Diego reported more than 700 college students with COVID-19. While California over the past few weeks has reported fewer COVID-19 cases, San Diego County experienced an increase of cases and may implement additional restrictions. Guidelines for reopening theme parks in the state are expected soon. The Pac-12 university athletic conference said that they are delayed from joining the Big Ten in playing football this season because of necessary California and Oregon local approvals, but Californiaís governor said that the stateís law is not preventing the Pac-12 from playing. California fitness centers filed a lawsuit against the governor alleging that they were unfairly targeted when the state forced them to close.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 28, Californiaís governor signed an executive order to help the state increase its testing capacity. The governor also signed an executive order extending state protections for consumers against price gouging. In addition, the governor shared a new plan that will guide countiesí reopening called the Blueprint for a Safer Economy. The plan will replace the former County Data Monitoring List. The Blueprint framework will use tiers to determine the reopening of non-essential indoor businesses and schools in different counties. Blueprint tiers in each county are determined by case rates and positivity rates or the percentage of positive tests in a county. Each countyís tier and the colour they are assigned will determine how businesses in that county operate. Counties must wait 21 days prior to progressing to another tier and can only progress through one tier at a time after successfully meeting the qualifications for the new tier for two consecutive weeks. The mandatory waiting period is a new concept introduced with the Blueprint. Schools in a county may open after that county is out of the Widespread tier, or tier one, with discussions starting at the earliest two weeks after leaving the Widespread tier. As of September 8, approximately 87% of Californiaís population was in the most restrictive tier.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are beginning to decrease in California.  California removed San Diego County from its COVID-19 monitoring list, which is used to determine and limit the activities permitted in different counties. The Glendale Unified School District will reopen some of their elementary schools as a supervised location for the children of essential workers to complete remote school work. The supervisors will not be teachers and will only monitor mask use, distancing, keeping the children focused and assisting with technology problems. There will be 12 children per classroom, with breakfast and lunch delivered, and technology devices provided.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While the COVID-19 transmission rate in LA County is declining, the rate is still increasing in some California counties. Hospitalizations are falling in the state after seeming to peak in late July, but deaths appear to have accelerated--with most of the stateís deaths occurring after Memorial Day. LAís mayor is working with scientific experts, bioscience firms, government leaders and foundations to develop at-home COVID-19 testing. LA Countyís public health director said that college and university classes would need to be remote because the rate of the disease is still too high.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California has reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the US: a total of approximately 530,000 cases and 9,800 deaths. Approximately 40% of Californiaís cases have either been in or near Los Angeles County. In late July, Californiaís governor expressed concern over COVID-19 becoming the second leading cause of death in LA County, after deaths caused by heart disease. As of August 7, LA authorities were granted permission to cut back on water and power supply to homes and businesses that repeatedly hosted large gatherings. California released guidance for colleges and universities to reopen, including with regards to testing and housing. A University of California, San Francisco epidemiologist suggests that, while California's second wave is ending, the state will not be able to achieve a baseline of cases prior to a third wave. Californiaís public health director resigned days after a glitch in the system led to a delay in reporting COVID-19 test results used for reopening decision making.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 29, California reported its second highest daily death toll from COVID-19. However, as of August 4, California experienced its first decline in weekly new COVID-19 cases in the last 12 weeks. The governor said that California needs to increase public education about COVID-19 to discourage behaviours that contribute to a surge in cases. As of July 30, 21 of 58 California counties, which are home to 10% of Californiaís population, were permitted to reopen indoor salons and businesses pending local restrictions. On July 29, the Orange County Board of Education announced that they were suing the Governor of California and the California Public Health Officer to obtain a court order allowing schools to have in person classes and on campus services. The board says the order is necessary to create equal learning opportunities for children from underprivileged families, who would be unequally burdened otherwise. Local salon owners and employees are protesting for the reopening of personal care businesses in California, which they said have been forced to operate underground--something that is even less sanitary.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There is speculation that California is poised to surpass New York as the state with the most COVID-19 cases. Epidemiologists suggest that some counties in the state repealed their mask requirements too early and that some patients have gone out in public without masks. Data suggests that the group aged 40 and under and the Latino community are experiencing the transmission at higher levels. On July 15, some of the largest school districts in Orange County said they would not follow the Orange County Board of Education recommendation to reopen in person. Three churches in Northern California are challenging in court the stateís ban on singing and chanting in church -- saying it violates their right to free speech and to religion.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past two weeks, COVID-19 related hospitalizations have increased 28% in the state. As of June 18, masks became mandatory in indoor public spaces including public transit and medical care and in outdoor public spaces if distancing was not possible, but there was no explanation about how this would be enforced. Two of the largest school districts in California, Los Angeles and San Diego, announced on July 13 that their schools would not reopen in-person in August and would remain online. As of July 17, Governor Newsom presented guidelines for schools to reopen, which includes a requirement that schools cannot reopen in counties that are on the stateís monitoring list (31 of the 58 counties are on this list). Due to increasing positive cases and community transmission, on July 13 the California governor ordered that counties close indoor activities like bars, fitness centres, places of worship, non-essential offices, personal care services, hair salons and barbers. Meanwhile, restuarants, wineries, tastings, theaters, zoos and museums could remain open if they operated outdoors.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California, Texas, Arizona and Florida account for 50% of cases in the US. Over the past two weeks, California has had a 44% increase in hospitalizations and a 34% increase in ICU patients. The governor says the state is prepared for increasing hospitalizations. On July 8, Los Angeles reported increasing infection rates and hospitalization rates as high as they were in April, which made them a high risk level city. On July 7, California reported 114 deaths in 24 hours. On July 9, California reported 149 deaths in 24 hours, a record high compared to the last high of 155 set on April 22. UC Berkeley reported 47 new cases in one week and connected some of them to sorority and fraternity parties. Most sectors now have a guide for their reopening. Prior to pausing Californiaís reopening last week, most of the state was in phase 3--leaving only Alameda County and Imperial County not in phases 2.5 or 3. While phase 4 allows concerts, festivals, convention centres and sports events with audiences, experts do not expect this to happen until there is a vaccine. Schools are planning to reopen in September using hybrid models; however, every school district from K-12 is required to create a distant learning plan in the event that reopening in-person classes is delayed.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A majority of the positive results in Sacramento are among individuals between 18 and 49 years old. California is rolling back some reopening policies. In response to an increase in daily new cases, Governor Newsom ordered dine-in restaurants in 19 counties to return to outdoor service or to close; he imposed additional restrictions on cinemas, bowling alleys, game rooms and warehouses. Bars were closed on June 28. Before the long weekend, Los Angeles canceled fireworks, closed beaches and closed beach parking in Southern California and the Bay area. California is in phase 2 of its reopening plan which allows stores, offices, outdoor museums and child care to reopen with limitations. After the June 18 decision to make masks mandatory, some police forces in the Sacramento area said that they would not be enforcing the rule.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California has seen a rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and ICU rates. On June 22, the state saw a record of 5000 daily cases and passed this on June 23 with over 7000 cases. A June 18 order requires masks in public with exceptions. As of June 12, schools, gyms, movie theatres, and bars reopened with health restrictions. Disney is postponing its anticipated mid-July reopening in California. During the week of June 29, several counties will reopen personal contact services, dine-in service, short term rentals and more, but the governor suggests the state may regress in reopening if cases and hospitalizations continue increasing.</p>
