  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A majority of the positive results in Sacramento are among individuals between 18 and 49 years old. California is rolling back some reopening policies. In response to an increase in daily new cases, Governor Newsom ordered dine-in restaurants in 19 counties to return to outdoor service or to close; he imposed additional restrictions on cinemas, bowling alleys, game rooms and warehouses. Bars were closed on June 28. Before the long weekend, Los Angeles canceled fireworks, closed beaches and closed beach parking in Southern California and the Bay area. California is in phase 2 of its reopening plan which allows stores, offices, outdoor museums and child care to reopen with limitations. After the June 18 decision to make masks mandatory, some police forces in the Sacramento area said that they would not be enforcing the rule.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California has seen a rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and ICU rates. On June 22, the state saw a record of 5000 daily cases and passed this on June 23 with over 7000 cases. A June 18 order requires masks in public with exceptions. As of June 12, schools, gyms, movie theatres, and bars reopened with health restrictions. Disney is postponing its anticipated mid-July reopening in California. During the week of June 29, several counties will reopen personal contact services, dine-in service, short term rentals and more, but the governor suggests the state may regress in reopening if cases and hospitalizations continue increasing.</p>
