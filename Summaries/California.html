  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California, Texas, Arizona and Florida account for 50% of cases in the US. Over the past two weeks, California has had a 44% increase in hospitalizations and a 34% increase in ICU patients. The governor says the state is prepared for increasing hospitalizations. On July 8, Los Angeles reported increasing infection rates and hospitalization rates as high as they were in April, which made them a high risk level city. On July 7, California reported 114 deaths in 24 hours. On July 9, California reported 149 deaths in 24 hours, a record high compared to the last high of 155 set on April 22. UC Berkeley reported 47 new cases in one week and connected some of them to sorority and fraternity parties. Most sectors now have a guide for their reopening. Prior to pausing Californiaâ€™s reopening last week, most of the state was in phase 3--leaving only Alameda County and Imperial County not in phases 2.5 or 3. While phase 4 allows concerts, festivals, convention centres and sports events with audiences, experts do not expect this to happen until there is a vaccine. Schools are planning to reopen in September using hybrid models; however, every school district from K-12 is required to create a distant learning plan in the event that reopening in-person classes is delayed.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A majority of the positive results in Sacramento are among individuals between 18 and 49 years old. California is rolling back some reopening policies. In response to an increase in daily new cases, Governor Newsom ordered dine-in restaurants in 19 counties to return to outdoor service or to close; he imposed additional restrictions on cinemas, bowling alleys, game rooms and warehouses. Bars were closed on June 28. Before the long weekend, Los Angeles canceled fireworks, closed beaches and closed beach parking in Southern California and the Bay area. California is in phase 2 of its reopening plan which allows stores, offices, outdoor museums and child care to reopen with limitations. After the June 18 decision to make masks mandatory, some police forces in the Sacramento area said that they would not be enforcing the rule.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California has seen a rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and ICU rates. On June 22, the state saw a record of 5000 daily cases and passed this on June 23 with over 7000 cases. A June 18 order requires masks in public with exceptions. As of June 12, schools, gyms, movie theatres, and bars reopened with health restrictions. Disney is postponing its anticipated mid-July reopening in California. During the week of June 29, several counties will reopen personal contact services, dine-in service, short term rentals and more, but the governor suggests the state may regress in reopening if cases and hospitalizations continue increasing.</p>
