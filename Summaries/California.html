  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California reported a single-day record of 764 deaths on January 22. However, hospitalizations have fallen 10% in the past two weeks, with the positivity rate falling 15%. Sacramento’s stay home order was lifted, allowing outdoor dining, hair salons, and places of worship to reopen, with a higher capacity limit for retailers. Despite a revision to the state’s return-to-school plan, a large number of educators indicated their displeasure with the plan. The governor’s proposal requires that schools provide COVID-19 testing for staff and students, creating additional costs. Residents have expressed frustration with the governor’s decision to expand priority access to the vaccine to people between the ages of 65 and 74 alongside healthcare workers and long-term care staff. Some Californians are concerned that the vaccination process will become more confusing when the government begins vaccinating people with a second dose while some residents are still receiving their first dose.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The occupancy rate for ICU beds and the COVID-19 positivity rate have both fallen; the positivity rate was 14% on January 8 and fell to 13.4% by January 15. Between January 1 and January 15, over 6,300 Californians died from COVID-19, accounting for nearly 20% of total COVID-19 fatalities in the state. Approximately 530 Californians die daily from COVID-19. Almost 90% of Californians are affected by stay-at-home orders, with projections suggesting that ICU capacity will be in a critical situation for at least four more weeks. Los Angeles County is running out of space for deceased COVID-19 patients and has ordered additional refrigerated storage units. L.A.’s Dodger Stadium, San Diego’s Petco Park and Sacramento’s Cal Expo will become mass vaccination sites, while the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim will be the first “super” COVID-19 vaccination site in Orange County. After the governor said that schools might reopen in February, several superintendents wrote a letter asking him for state standards to determine when it is safe to return to school.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of December 19, California reported nearly 17,400 COVID-related hospitalizations, which is more than double the July peak.  Officials estimate that the number of hospitalizations could reach as high as 75,000 by the middle of January. The state also reported 3,600 confirmed or possible COVID-19 patients in the ICU. Much of the state, with the chief exception of northern California, is at the stay-at-home level of reopening. Some hospitals cancelled non-essential elective surgeries, like hip replacements, because of the demand for medical care created by COVID-19. Doctors are receiving calls from wealthy people in southern California offering to pay in order to receive the COVID-19 vaccine earlier than permitted; the governor said they will monitor these requests. Restaurant owners had a caravan protest to call for reopening and outdoor dining. Eleven state senators are asking the governor to declare restaurants essential.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 8, California reported 35,400 COVID-19 cases and 219 deaths -- a record number of cases and deaths in 24 hours. CaliforniaÕs weekly average of deaths was 135 per day for the past week, compared to the 44 deaths per day average in November. The governor implemented a new regional stay-at-home order on December 3 for regions that report ICU availability below 15%. All of Central and Southern California, and parts of Northern California, the Bay Area and Sacramento, are in the stay-at-home level of reopening -- which means that bars, wineries and personal care services are closed and private gatherings are prohibited. Schools with a waiver may remain open, as can critical infrastructure and restaurants offering take-out or delivery. Hotels are only permitted to accept guests travelling for essential reasons and with limited occupancy. The governor has left enforcing the rules to local governments, but threatened to pull funding from counties who do not enforce compliance. The rest of California is in Purple on the stateÕs reopening indicator list, which means that there is a curfew between 10 pm and 5 am until December 2 -- along with limited non-essential activities. 325,000 Pfizer vaccines will be distributed to health workers and long term care residents.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 4, California reported 25,000 new cases and 209 deaths in the previous day. Approximately 33% of California's hospitalizations are COVID-19 cases. The average number of cases for the last week was 16,821 cases per day, which is a 60% increase compared to two weeks prior. Since ICUs in several regions have little available space, on December 6, Southern California and San Joaquin ValleyÕs stay-at-home orders began: closing bars, hair salons, and barbers, and only permitting take-out and delivery. San Francisco Bay area also began a lockdown, which will be from December 6 to January 4. Central Valley also began a similar lockdown. The lockdowns are anticipated last a minimum of three weeks, which will include the Christmas holidays, but supermarkets and shopping centers may operate at 20% capacity. CaliforniaÕs lockdowns come into effect in regions that have less than 15% of available ICU capacity; the lockdown closes many businesses like sports, salons, and in-person dining, but schools with waivers can remain open for in-person learning. Religious services and beaches remain open. Individual and outdoor fitness classes are permitted, but gatherings are prohibited.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 28, California reported 15,600 new cases. Over the past 14 days, CaliforniaÕs hospitalizations have doubled. On November 29, California broke a record with 7,415 coronavirus hospitalizations. There have been over 19,000 COVID-19 deaths in the state. LA CountyÕs number of hospitalizations is nearing approximately 80 new patients daily over a seven-day period. San Francisco is now in phase one of reopening, which imposes a curfew between 10 pm and 5 am for non-essential work, movement, gatherings and outdoor dining. There are zero counties in yellow or phase four (which is the most open), one county in orange or phase three, six countries in red or phase two, and 41 counties in purple or phase one (which is the most restricted).</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past ten days, CaliforniaÕs daily number of new cases had doubled -- the fastest increase in cases since the beginning of the pandemic. Authorities blame the increase on private gatherings and parties. As of November 17, over 40 counties regressed to purple, or phase one, on the stateÕs reopening indicators. Approximately 94% of Californians are now in the purple phase and, at this level, restaurants, gyms and religious centres are closed. On November 21, California implemented a minimum month-long curfew for counties in purple from 10 pm to 5 am, which requires people to stay home unless leaving for groceries, emergencies, take-out or walking dogs. LA County authorities have said that they may implement additional measures. Non-essential activities have been restricted in San Francisco and fitness centers and gyms can only operate with up to 10% capacity. Disneyland has not reopened attractions, but the theme park is now open for dining and retail. The governor apologized for attending an outdoor birthday party, which did not violate rules, but did contradict state recommendations.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 12, California passed 1 million COVID-19 cases. Over the past week, the stateÕs COVID-19 positivity rate increased to 4.2%.  This is the first time since September that the stateÕs positivity rate has exceeded 4%. Over the past two weeks, California had a 31% spike in hospitalizations. Eleven counties regressed in reopening. Sacramento, San Diego and Stanislaus joined LA in purple, which is stage one and prohibits indoor dining and in-person church, for example. No counties reopened further this week. Schools in Sacramento, San Diego and Stanislaus that are already in person may continue in person, but schools that have not already reopened must stay closed. Elementary schools may obtain a waiver from their countyÕs department of health to reopen in person. Museums have joined amusement parks, like Disney, in requests to reopen.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of November 4, California has seen a 13.5% increase in hospitalizations and a 20% increase in ICU patients over the previous two weeks. The stateÕs positivity rate also increased from 2.6% to 3.3% over the past two weeks. LA County also reported its highest daily number of cases since August, with no connection to the backlog of cases, and expects that the transmission rate is greater than 1.0. There has been a rise in northern California COVID-19 cases, so Shasta County regressed to purple and Plumas County regressed to orange on the governmentÕs reopening indicators. Orange County will also be regressing to purple in response to the rise in cases and an outbreak at a long term care home. Nevada County may also regress from orange to red, which officials associate with COVID-19 fatigue. Colusa County is progressing from red to orange.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 27, CaliforniaÕs COVID-19 test positivity rate was 2.9%, new ICU admissions increased by 5.9% and hospitalizations increased by 4.7%. On October 29, the weekly average of COVID-19 deaths fell to its lowest point since April. On October 27, seven counties progressed in reopening; one county entered yellow, four entered orange and two entered red. On October 27, CaliforniaÕs governor refused a request to allow large amusement parks to reopen. According to recently released regulations, large theme parks can reopen at 25% in the yellow tier, meaning fewer than 1 new case daily per 100,000 people in the county and a weekly average of positive cases lower than 2%. Smaller theme parks with a capacity of up to 15,000 people, can reopen at 25% or with 500 visitors in the orange tier. Counties in the orange have fewer than 4 new daily cases per 100,000 people and a weekly positive COVID-19 test rate under 5%. Sacramento County schools are now permitted in person. A new PCR testing facility that opened in Valencia can process over 150,000 tests daily and at a faster processing rate than before.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 22, California reported 6,359 new cases; approximately 2000 cases were from Los Angeles, where there has been a testing backlog. The daily average of cases has increased by 5.5%, while the weekly average case rate has increased 15.1%. As of October 26, California had a cumulative total of cases greater than 906,000 cases, the most cases in any one US state. On October 20, San Francisco entered yellow or phase four, which is the most open. As of October 20, all personal care services will be allowed indoors with regulations at all phases, meaning that certain personal care services, like estheticians, spas and tattoo parlors, previously forced to close when counties were in phase one can now be open. Approximately 60% of elementary and secondary students live in counties that are permitted to reopen in-person learning and some schools have already done so. California presented guidelines for amusement parks like Disneyland to reopen, but interpretations of the rules suggest that the parks could be closed anywhere from weeks or a year.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 16, California reported 2,979 new cases; CaliforniaÕs total COVID-19 cases reached 864,455, with 16,899 deaths. The COVID-19 case trends in the state have been falling; the weekly death-average fell to 57, which is 6.3% fewer than last week and the daily average of new cases fell to 3,097, which is 7.1% fewer than last week. Sutter County progressed from purple to red or phase one to phase two, Placer, El Dorado, Santa Clara and Alameda counties progressed from red to orange or phase two to phase three. Approximately eight counties are classified as phase four, which occurs when the daily infection rate is lower than 1 per 100,000 residents. The governor said that to ensure stable economic recovery, unlike after the first wave, California would have to reopen more slowly. The governor did not provide industry specifics, but theme park companies are complaining about the lack of guidelines for them.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">CaliforniaÕs average daily death count hit its lowest point over the past three months, suggesting an end to the wave of infections seen over the summer. The 7-day daily average reached 61, and the average deaths fell approximately 20% compared to last week and 28% compared to the two weeks prior. The reason behind this fall is connected to a decrease in deaths in Southern California and LA, which previously had accounted for approximately 40% of the stateÕs deaths. On October 9, the overall average of cases was 3300 cases per day.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 30, the governor enacted various bills that: prevent eviction and foreclosure, provide economic recovery packages, expand paid sick and family leave for front line workers and increase access to workersÕ compensation. He also passed bills related to some of the governorÕs executive actions taken as part of the pandemic response. CaliforniaÕs governor advocated for the HEROES act and encouraged White House and Senate officials to pass the bill that supports state, local, territorial and tribal governments and delivers economic relief to Americans.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 22, California health officials said that nine counties would progress into less restrictive reopening phases. The governmentÕs criteria for reopening counties include testing numbers and whether counties adequately test in diverse communities. Nail salons are permitted to reopen across the state depending on compliance with the sector specific health directives. Several schools in Orange County have resumed in person schooling since Orange County is classified as red or phase 2 on the stateÕs new reopening guide.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the week of September 14, the positivity rate in California was 3.5% -- which is the lowest that it has been since March. In August, positivity rates were almost double the current rate. California is the first state to conduct 13 million COVID-19 tests. The governor says that the government will continue including the number of college students with COVID-19 in their count of active cases. The suggestion to exclude college students with COVID-19 from the count of active cases came as San Diego reported more than 700 college students with COVID-19. While California over the past few weeks has reported fewer COVID-19 cases, San Diego County experienced an increase of cases and may implement additional restrictions. Guidelines for reopening theme parks in the state are expected soon. The Pac-12 university athletic conference said that they are delayed from joining the Big Ten in playing football this season because of necessary California and Oregon local approvals, but California’s governor said that the state’s law is not preventing the Pac-12 from playing. California fitness centers filed a lawsuit against the governor alleging that they were unfairly targeted when the state forced them to close.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 28, California’s governor signed an executive order to help the state increase its testing capacity. The governor also signed an executive order extending state protections for consumers against price gouging. In addition, the governor shared a new plan that will guide counties’ reopening called the Blueprint for a Safer Economy. The plan will replace the former County Data Monitoring List. The Blueprint framework will use tiers to determine the reopening of non-essential indoor businesses and schools in different counties. Blueprint tiers in each county are determined by case rates and positivity rates or the percentage of positive tests in a county. Each county’s tier and the colour they are assigned will determine how businesses in that county operate. Counties must wait 21 days prior to progressing to another tier and can only progress through one tier at a time after successfully meeting the qualifications for the new tier for two consecutive weeks. The mandatory waiting period is a new concept introduced with the Blueprint. Schools in a county may open after that county is out of the Widespread tier, or tier one, with discussions starting at the earliest two weeks after leaving the Widespread tier. As of September 8, approximately 87% of California’s population was in the most restrictive tier.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are beginning to decrease in California.  California removed San Diego County from its COVID-19 monitoring list, which is used to determine and limit the activities permitted in different counties. The Glendale Unified School District will reopen some of their elementary schools as a supervised location for the children of essential workers to complete remote school work. The supervisors will not be teachers and will only monitor mask use, distancing, keeping the children focused and assisting with technology problems. There will be 12 children per classroom, with breakfast and lunch delivered, and technology devices provided.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While the COVID-19 transmission rate in LA County is declining, the rate is still increasing in some California counties. Hospitalizations are falling in the state after seeming to peak in late July, but deaths appear to have accelerated--with most of the state’s deaths occurring after Memorial Day. LA’s mayor is working with scientific experts, bioscience firms, government leaders and foundations to develop at-home COVID-19 testing. LA County’s public health director said that college and university classes would need to be remote because the rate of the disease is still too high.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California has reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the US: a total of approximately 530,000 cases and 9,800 deaths. Approximately 40% of California’s cases have either been in or near Los Angeles County. In late July, California’s governor expressed concern over COVID-19 becoming the second leading cause of death in LA County, after deaths caused by heart disease. As of August 7, LA authorities were granted permission to cut back on water and power supply to homes and businesses that repeatedly hosted large gatherings. California released guidance for colleges and universities to reopen, including with regards to testing and housing. A University of California, San Francisco epidemiologist suggests that, while California's second wave is ending, the state will not be able to achieve a baseline of cases prior to a third wave. California’s public health director resigned days after a glitch in the system led to a delay in reporting COVID-19 test results used for reopening decision making.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 29, California reported its second highest daily death toll from COVID-19. However, as of August 4, California experienced its first decline in weekly new COVID-19 cases in the last 12 weeks. The governor said that California needs to increase public education about COVID-19 to discourage behaviours that contribute to a surge in cases. As of July 30, 21 of 58 California counties, which are home to 10% of California’s population, were permitted to reopen indoor salons and businesses pending local restrictions. On July 29, the Orange County Board of Education announced that they were suing the Governor of California and the California Public Health Officer to obtain a court order allowing schools to have in person classes and on campus services. The board says the order is necessary to create equal learning opportunities for children from underprivileged families, who would be unequally burdened otherwise. Local salon owners and employees are protesting for the reopening of personal care businesses in California, which they said have been forced to operate underground--something that is even less sanitary.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There is speculation that California is poised to surpass New York as the state with the most COVID-19 cases. Epidemiologists suggest that some counties in the state repealed their mask requirements too early and that some patients have gone out in public without masks. Data suggests that the group aged 40 and under and the Latino community are experiencing the transmission at higher levels. On July 15, some of the largest school districts in Orange County said they would not follow the Orange County Board of Education recommendation to reopen in person. Three churches in Northern California are challenging in court the state’s ban on singing and chanting in church -- saying it violates their right to free speech and to religion.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past two weeks, COVID-19 related hospitalizations have increased 28% in the state. As of June 18, masks became mandatory in indoor public spaces including public transit and medical care and in outdoor public spaces if distancing was not possible, but there was no explanation about how this would be enforced. Two of the largest school districts in California, Los Angeles and San Diego, announced on July 13 that their schools would not reopen in-person in August and would remain online. As of July 17, Governor Newsom presented guidelines for schools to reopen, which includes a requirement that schools cannot reopen in counties that are on the state’s monitoring list (31 of the 58 counties are on this list). Due to increasing positive cases and community transmission, on July 13 the California governor ordered that counties close indoor activities like bars, fitness centres, places of worship, non-essential offices, personal care services, hair salons and barbers. Meanwhile, restuarants, wineries, tastings, theaters, zoos and museums could remain open if they operated outdoors.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California, Texas, Arizona and Florida account for 50% of cases in the US. Over the past two weeks, California has had a 44% increase in hospitalizations and a 34% increase in ICU patients. The governor says the state is prepared for increasing hospitalizations. On July 8, Los Angeles reported increasing infection rates and hospitalization rates as high as they were in April, which made them a high risk level city. On July 7, California reported 114 deaths in 24 hours. On July 9, California reported 149 deaths in 24 hours, a record high compared to the last high of 155 set on April 22. UC Berkeley reported 47 new cases in one week and connected some of them to sorority and fraternity parties. Most sectors now have a guide for their reopening. Prior to pausing California’s reopening last week, most of the state was in phase 3--leaving only Alameda County and Imperial County not in phases 2.5 or 3. While phase 4 allows concerts, festivals, convention centres and sports events with audiences, experts do not expect this to happen until there is a vaccine. Schools are planning to reopen in September using hybrid models; however, every school district from K-12 is required to create a distant learning plan in the event that reopening in-person classes is delayed.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A majority of the positive results in Sacramento are among individuals between 18 and 49 years old. California is rolling back some reopening policies. In response to an increase in daily new cases, Governor Newsom ordered dine-in restaurants in 19 counties to return to outdoor service or to close; he imposed additional restrictions on cinemas, bowling alleys, game rooms and warehouses. Bars were closed on June 28. Before the long weekend, Los Angeles canceled fireworks, closed beaches and closed beach parking in Southern California and the Bay area. California is in phase 2 of its reopening plan which allows stores, offices, outdoor museums and child care to reopen with limitations. After the June 18 decision to make masks mandatory, some police forces in the Sacramento area said that they would not be enforcing the rule.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California has seen a rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and ICU rates. On June 22, the state saw a record of 5000 daily cases and passed this on June 23 with over 7000 cases. A June 18 order requires masks in public with exceptions. As of June 12, schools, gyms, movie theatres, and bars reopened with health restrictions. Disney is postponing its anticipated mid-July reopening in California. During the week of June 29, several counties will reopen personal contact services, dine-in service, short term rentals and more, but the governor suggests the state may regress in reopening if cases and hospitalizations continue increasing.</p>
