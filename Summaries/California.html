      California has seen a rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and ICU rates. On June 22, the state saw a record of 5000 daily cases and passed this on June 23 with over 7000 cases. A June 18 order requires masks in public with exceptions. As of June 12, schools, gyms, movie theatres, and bars reopened with health restrictions. Disney is postponing its anticipated mid-July reopening in California. During the week of June 29, several counties will reopen personal contact services, dine-in service, short term rentals and more, but the governor suggests the state may regress in reopening if cases and hospitalizations continue increasing.
