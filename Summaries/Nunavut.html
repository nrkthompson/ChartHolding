  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quarantine is no longer required for travellers between Nunavut and Churchill, Manitoba as long as they have been in either place for at least two weeks prior. All alcohol-licensed establishments can resume their regular operating hours starting July 20, but must continue to follow social distancing. There are two more presumptive cases at the Mary River mine. All three presumptive cases at the mine are linked to a private gathering that took place before the infected individuals entered Nunavut. If there continues to be no cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut communities, all public schools in the territory are likely to open without social distancing protocols in September. A full plan for the upcoming school year is expected to be released early next week after the Iqaluit District Education Authority expressed its frustrations over the lack of information provided by the territory. Premier Joe Savikataaq is defending his decision to bypass an isolation hub and self-isolate at his cabin following a trip to Winnipeg to retrieve his personal plane. Savikataaq has faced criticism over self-isolating at his personal property while all other Nunavut residents must use an isolation hub before returning home.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A test result that was meant to confirm the territory’s first presumptive case of COVID-19 has come back negative. The sample was sent to a public health lab in Ontario because the testing equipment used initially was not accredited by Health Canada. While the case is still considered a presumptive positive due to the initial tests, the affected individuals and all close contacts are now out of isolation. The government is setting up two machines that can confirm diagnoses of COVID-19 in the territory. The new machines would mean the territory no longer has to send samples to the provinces for confirmation, and would drastically increase testing capacity. Once the devices are set up and approved by Health Canada, the government said it would revisit the requirement that all those entering the territory self-isolate for 14 days. Nunavut has extended its public health emergency order until July 23.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The territorial government announced that it had its first presumptive case of COVID-19: a person working at the Mary River mine on Baffin Island. The individual is from outside the territory, and all known contacts of the person are now in isolation. No workers at the facility are from Nunavut, and operations at the mine will continue as usual. Confirmation of the positive test is expected to arrive this week. Nunavut had previously announced a presumptive case in April, but the test result turned out to be a false positive. The government has said that the positive test will not affect the territory’s reopening plan, and there is no risk of infection for Nunavut community members. The outdoor gathering limit was increased to 50 people on June 29. Some indoor facilities can have up to 50% capacity or 50 people, whichever number is lower.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut lifted various lockdown restrictions this week, allowing bars and restaurants to open at 50% capacity, personal care services to resume, and theatres and churches to reopen. There will be no formal limit on the number of people a person can socialize with at bars or restaurants, though the territory’s Chief Public Health Officer continues to advise that social distancing regulations remain in place. Additionally, the government announced that youth activities may resume on June 29, and some long-term care facilities may permit visitors. Although residents of Nunavut may travel to the Yukon on July 1, the territorial government will mandate that travellers quarantine for two weeks upon their return.</p>
