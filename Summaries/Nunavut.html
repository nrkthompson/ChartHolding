      Nunavut lifted various lockdown restrictions this week, allowing bars and restaurants to open at 50% capacity, personal care services to resume, and theatres and churches to reopen. There will be no formal limit on the number of people a person can socialize with at bars or restaurants, though the territoryâ€™s Chief Public Health Officer continues to advise that social distancing regulations remain in place. Additionally, the government announced that youth activities may resume on June 29, and some long-term care facilities may permit visitors. Although residents of Nunavut may travel to the Yukon on July 1, the territorial government will mandate that travellers quarantine for two weeks upon their return.
