  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There are 108 active cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut as of November 30. The number of active cases has fallen over the past few days as the number of those considered to be recovered rises rapidly. No deaths or hospitalizations have been reported. Cases are concentrated in the Kivalliq region. While no severe cases have been reported, authorities are concerned that the shrinking ICU capacity in Winnipeg will force them to look elsewhere if a Nunavut resident becomes acutely ill. There is no ICU in any hospital in Nunavut, though there are backup ventilators in Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet. If no cases are reported outside of the Kivalliq region, officials said that restrictions in other regions may be eased once the territory-wide lockdown order ends on December 2. The federal government has given the territory nearly $20 million in additional funding in order to deal with the outbreak.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There are 134 active cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut as of November 23, including 98 in Arviat. All other cases are in Sanikiluaq, Rankin Inlet, and Whale Cove, though officials said there does not appear to be extensive transmission in those communities. Due to the outbreak, a territory-wide lockdown will be in place until at least December 2. Restaurants can only offer takeout services. All non-essential workplaces, contact services, leisure facilities, cultural activities, and non-emergency health centres must close. The gathering limit remains 5 people. Residents have been advised to wear a mask in public spaces. The travel bubble with the Northwest Territories has been suspended. Individuals who have travelled through Arviat since November 2 must immediately self-isolate for 14 days.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After Nunavut reported its first two confirmed cases of COVID-19 last week, six others have been diagnosed in Rankin Inlet and Arviat -- both in the Kivalliq region. The cases appear to be connected to the Winnipeg isolation hub, where Nunavut community members who have travelled out-of-territory must stay for two weeks before returning home. The Kivalliq region has gone into lockdown, with only essential services remaining open and travel between communities prohibited. Residents must wear a mask if they leave their home; indoor gatherings are banned and outdoor gatherings are limited to five people. Restrictions were also introduced in Iqaluit out of caution: eateries and bars are limited to 50% capacity, mandatory mask policy for visitors to long-term care homes, a public gathering limit of 50 people, and a private gathering limit of 5 people. Schools in Iqaluit have moved to stage 2 of the territory’s plan, with staggered attendance for middle and high school students.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut’s first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Sanikiluaq. Contact tracing has been initiated and the individual and their family are currently in isolation. A second member of the same household has also tested positive. The government has asked residents of Sanikiluaq to remain at home and avoid contact with people outside their household. All emergency services in the town are operational; masks are mandatory in all grocery stores. The positive case does not affect the territory’s travel bubble with the Northwest Territories and Churchill, Manitoba. Due to a substantial increase in the number of cases in Manitoba, medical travel from Nunavut’s Kivalliq region may be affected.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The two presumptive cases of COVID-19 at the Meliadine gold mine have been confirmed following additional testing at a public health lab in Quebec. Another presumptive case at the mine was also discovered, and the individual and all their close contacts have been flown out-of-territory. There is minimal risk of community transmission from the site at this time. The territorial government has extended their public health emergency order another two weeks until November 12. The health minister said that an isolation period at home and rapid testing will not replace stints at isolation hubs in southern Canada, despite rising demand due to the upcoming holidays. Plans to eliminate tuberculosis in the territory have been scaled back due to the pandemic.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut has confirmed a case of COVID-19 at the Mary River mine, although there is no evidence of further transmission at the site. Two additional presumptive cases have been reported at the Meliadine gold mine, with those workers and their close contacts now in self-isolation. No Nunavut community members are currently working at either site, and the government has emphasized that the risk of spread remains low. The territorial government warned that it would consider closing its common travel area with the Northwest Territories and parts of northern Manitoba if the situation continues to deteriorate in the rest of Canada. Authorities continue to advise that residents do not travel outside the territory. Concerns have been raised about isolation hub departure protocols after flights to Nunavut were found to have both essential workers, who do not need to isolate, and returning residents.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No presumptive cases were reported in Nunavut this week. The minister of health extended the territory’s public health emergency orders until October 29. All existing restrictions remain in effect. The territorial government is urging all residents to get their flu shot, which will be available in all communities within the next few weeks.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut’s chief medical health officer said that the COVID-19 outbreak at the Hope Bay gold mine has been contained and there is no evidence of further transmission. Contrary to initial reports, the cases will not count against the territory’s total, as each worker’s home jurisdiction has counted the case as one of their own. Those who were not high-risk contacts of the infected persons will be permitted to leave the mine site in the coming days. The territorial government eased a number of restrictions this week. The gathering limit was expanded to 100 people, restaurants and bars can open to 75% capacity, and cultural institutions can have up to 50% capacity. All gym facilities and recreation centres can host individual or group workouts, and athletic events can have up to 50 spectators and 50 participants.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ten cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed at the Hope Bay gold mine; these newly diagnosed cases will be the first to count as part of the territory’s total, as all previous cases were found to have originated elsewhere in the country. Another confirmed case at a separate mine in Rankin Inlet resulted in the infected person, who did not come into contact with any residents of Nunavut, being sent back to their home province. While the government said there is minimal risk of transmission to community members, they reminded residents to follow all public health recommendations. The territorial government has extended their public health emergency orders another two weeks to October 15. The chief public health officer of Nunavut announced that essential workers who enter the territory without completing an isolation period must wear a mask at all times when outside of their dwelling for the first two weeks of their residency.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The territorial government is attempting to purchase resources for distance learning if schools are forced to close once again, but the lack of infrastructure in Nunavut has made preparation difficult. The government has asked educators to prepare take-home lesson plans in the event of a closure, but the president of the Nunavut Teachers’ Association said that they should be focused on ensuring online access to learning materials. Nunavut’s health minister said that residents should avoid travelling to the provinces for holidays if they can. A surge in demand for access to isolation hubs is expected, and the territorial government has not laid out their funding plan for the facilities into the new year. After an isolation exemption for Nunavut government officials received criticism, the health minister said that an exemption would not be granted for non-essential travel, and that he did not believe that any official would take advantage of the exemption unless absolutely necessary since no one has asked him for one in the month since it was put in place.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government of Nunavut has extended its public health emergency orders for another two weeks -- through October 1. Two cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed at the Hope Bay gold mine in western Nunavut. The two workers are asymptomatic and were infected prior to their arrival in Nunavut. Another presumptive case has been reported at the Mary River mine. There is no evidence of further spread at either site and operations continue as normal. There is no threat of transmission to Nunavut communities since all workers at both mines are from outside the territory and have no off-site access to the territory. The territorial government is looking for ways to limit alcohol access at isolation hubs in Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Ottawa following reports of unruly behaviour at all three facilities.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A guard at an isolation hub for Nunavut residents has tested positive for COVID-19. 24 of the hubís residents had low-risk contact with the guard, all of whom have since returned to Nunavut. While the territoryís Chief Public Health Officer said that the exposed residents pose minimal risk to the public, he asked that all Nunavut residents continue to follow hygiene and social distancing guidelines. The territory is beginning a pilot project this week that could see testing capacity in Nunavut increase and some restrictions eased. Samples will be analyzed in Iqaluit, with the aim of returning results within 5 days of each test. If successful, the project may eliminate the need for Nunavut residents to self-isolate outside the territory before returning home. However, the government said that some form of isolation period will remain in effect for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There continue to be no cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut. It remains the only province or territory in Canada to have not had a single case. The territorial government extended its public health emergency order until September 3 after it was set to expire on August 20.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut continues to report no cases of COVID-19 in the territory. In contrast to the governmentís plan for elementary and secondary schools, Nunavut Arctic College plans to have its students and staff practice social distancing when on campus and in class. Most programs will have a smaller class size, with assigned seating and designated classrooms. All those on campus will need to sign in each day in order to perform contact tracing if necessary. Campus amenities like libraries and computer labs will operate at 50% capacity.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut extended its public health emergency order to August 20. Nunavut government officials no longer need to self-isolate when going to and from the territory--as long as they are travelling on official business. Authorities still have the option to enter an isolation hub if they wish, and the exemption does not apply to family members or staff. The isolation period is expected to remain in place until the territory obtains adequate testing capacity. The school year began this week in some parts of Nunavut with all students expected to attend in-person. Enhanced cleaning protocols are in place and limited group activities will be conducted. No guests (including parents) will be allowed into schools.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government of Nunavut has opened an additional isolation hub for medical travellers at a hotel in Winnipeg to relieve demand after weeks-long wait times at other locations were reported. Nunavut is hoping to develop a medical travel bubble with other jurisdictions in Canada to eliminate the need for a two-week isolation period before returning to the territory. The Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities is encouraging its local affiliates to adopt the territoryís school reopening plan, but officials from the Coalition are concerned about complying with additional cleaning requirements and the ability of children to follow social distancing regulations if there are outbreaks reported in Nunavut. Baker Lake will be the first Nunavut community to go back to school on August 7.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavutís public health emergency order was extended until August 6. All presumptive cases of COVID-19 at the Mary River mine have come back negative after confirmation testing in Ontario. As a precaution, the two more recent cases and their close contacts will remain in quarantine until July 29 despite the negative tests. Chief Public Health Officer Michael Patterson said it is possible that all three individuals had COVID-19 previously, which is why they returned positive tests at the mine. Patterson defended the testing equipment used, saying that false positives occur all the time in other regions, but they are under a greater spotlight in Nunavut because there have been no confirmed cases. The territory has released its school reopening plan -- confirming that it will resume in-person classes with no physical distancing as long as there continues to be no COVID-19 cases in Nunavut communities. If cases are reported, schools will be shut down gradually in order to prevent further spread. All schools will undergo enhanced cleaning and hygiene procedures.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quarantine is no longer required for travellers between Nunavut and Churchill, Manitoba as long as they have been in either place for at least two weeks prior. All alcohol-licensed establishments can resume their regular operating hours starting July 20, but must continue to follow social distancing. There are two more presumptive cases at the Mary River mine. All three presumptive cases at the mine are linked to a private gathering that took place before the infected individuals entered Nunavut. If there continues to be no cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut communities, all public schools in the territory are likely to open without social distancing protocols in September. A full plan for the upcoming school year is expected to be released early next week after the Iqaluit District Education Authority expressed its frustrations over the lack of information provided by the territory. Premier Joe Savikataaq is defending his decision to bypass an isolation hub and self-isolate at his cabin following a trip to Winnipeg to retrieve his personal plane. Savikataaq has faced criticism over self-isolating at his personal property while all other Nunavut residents must use an isolation hub before returning home.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A test result that was meant to confirm the territoryís first presumptive case of COVID-19 has come back negative. The sample was sent to a public health lab in Ontario because the testing equipment used initially was not accredited by Health Canada. While the case is still considered a presumptive positive due to the initial tests, the affected individuals and all close contacts are now out of isolation. The government is setting up two machines that can confirm diagnoses of COVID-19 in the territory. The new machines would mean the territory no longer has to send samples to the provinces for confirmation, and would drastically increase testing capacity. Once the devices are set up and approved by Health Canada, the government said it would revisit the requirement that all those entering the territory self-isolate for 14 days. Nunavut has extended its public health emergency order until July 23.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The territorial government announced that it had its first presumptive case of COVID-19: a person working at the Mary River mine on Baffin Island. The individual is from outside the territory, and all known contacts of the person are now in isolation. No workers at the facility are from Nunavut, and operations at the mine will continue as usual. Confirmation of the positive test is expected to arrive this week. Nunavut had previously announced a presumptive case in April, but the test result turned out to be a false positive. The government has said that the positive test will not affect the territoryís reopening plan, and there is no risk of infection for Nunavut community members. The outdoor gathering limit was increased to 50 people on June 29. Some indoor facilities can have up to 50% capacity or 50 people, whichever number is lower.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut lifted various lockdown restrictions this week, allowing bars and restaurants to open at 50% capacity, personal care services to resume, and theatres and churches to reopen. There will be no formal limit on the number of people a person can socialize with at bars or restaurants, though the territoryís Chief Public Health Officer continues to advise that social distancing regulations remain in place. Additionally, the government announced that youth activities may resume on June 29, and some long-term care facilities may permit visitors. Although residents of Nunavut may travel to the Yukon on July 1, the territorial government will mandate that travellers quarantine for two weeks upon their return.</p>
