  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government of Nunavut has extended its public health emergency orders for another two weeks -- through October 1. Two cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed at the Hope Bay gold mine in western Nunavut. The two workers are asymptomatic and were infected prior to their arrival in Nunavut. Another presumptive case has been reported at the Mary River mine. There is no evidence of further spread at either site and operations continue as normal. There is no threat of transmission to Nunavut communities since all workers at both mines are from outside the territory and have no off-site access to the territory. The territorial government is looking for ways to limit alcohol access at isolation hubs in Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Ottawa following reports of unruly behaviour at all three facilities.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A guard at an isolation hub for Nunavut residents has tested positive for COVID-19. 24 of the hub’s residents had low-risk contact with the guard, all of whom have since returned to Nunavut. While the territory’s Chief Public Health Officer said that the exposed residents pose minimal risk to the public, he asked that all Nunavut residents continue to follow hygiene and social distancing guidelines. The territory is beginning a pilot project this week that could see testing capacity in Nunavut increase and some restrictions eased. Samples will be analyzed in Iqaluit, with the aim of returning results within 5 days of each test. If successful, the project may eliminate the need for Nunavut residents to self-isolate outside the territory before returning home. However, the government said that some form of isolation period will remain in effect for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There continue to be no cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut. It remains the only province or territory in Canada to have not had a single case. The territorial government extended its public health emergency order until September 3 after it was set to expire on August 20.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut continues to report no cases of COVID-19 in the territory. In contrast to the government’s plan for elementary and secondary schools, Nunavut Arctic College plans to have its students and staff practice social distancing when on campus and in class. Most programs will have a smaller class size, with assigned seating and designated classrooms. All those on campus will need to sign in each day in order to perform contact tracing if necessary. Campus amenities like libraries and computer labs will operate at 50% capacity.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut extended its public health emergency order to August 20. Nunavut government officials no longer need to self-isolate when going to and from the territory--as long as they are travelling on official business. Authorities still have the option to enter an isolation hub if they wish, and the exemption does not apply to family members or staff. The isolation period is expected to remain in place until the territory obtains adequate testing capacity. The school year began this week in some parts of Nunavut with all students expected to attend in-person. Enhanced cleaning protocols are in place and limited group activities will be conducted. No guests (including parents) will be allowed into schools.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government of Nunavut has opened an additional isolation hub for medical travellers at a hotel in Winnipeg to relieve demand after weeks-long wait times at other locations were reported. Nunavut is hoping to develop a medical travel bubble with other jurisdictions in Canada to eliminate the need for a two-week isolation period before returning to the territory. The Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities is encouraging its local affiliates to adopt the territory’s school reopening plan, but officials from the Coalition are concerned about complying with additional cleaning requirements and the ability of children to follow social distancing regulations if there are outbreaks reported in Nunavut. Baker Lake will be the first Nunavut community to go back to school on August 7.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut’s public health emergency order was extended until August 6. All presumptive cases of COVID-19 at the Mary River mine have come back negative after confirmation testing in Ontario. As a precaution, the two more recent cases and their close contacts will remain in quarantine until July 29 despite the negative tests. Chief Public Health Officer Michael Patterson said it is possible that all three individuals had COVID-19 previously, which is why they returned positive tests at the mine. Patterson defended the testing equipment used, saying that false positives occur all the time in other regions, but they are under a greater spotlight in Nunavut because there have been no confirmed cases. The territory has released its school reopening plan -- confirming that it will resume in-person classes with no physical distancing as long as there continues to be no COVID-19 cases in Nunavut communities. If cases are reported, schools will be shut down gradually in order to prevent further spread. All schools will undergo enhanced cleaning and hygiene procedures.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quarantine is no longer required for travellers between Nunavut and Churchill, Manitoba as long as they have been in either place for at least two weeks prior. All alcohol-licensed establishments can resume their regular operating hours starting July 20, but must continue to follow social distancing. There are two more presumptive cases at the Mary River mine. All three presumptive cases at the mine are linked to a private gathering that took place before the infected individuals entered Nunavut. If there continues to be no cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut communities, all public schools in the territory are likely to open without social distancing protocols in September. A full plan for the upcoming school year is expected to be released early next week after the Iqaluit District Education Authority expressed its frustrations over the lack of information provided by the territory. Premier Joe Savikataaq is defending his decision to bypass an isolation hub and self-isolate at his cabin following a trip to Winnipeg to retrieve his personal plane. Savikataaq has faced criticism over self-isolating at his personal property while all other Nunavut residents must use an isolation hub before returning home.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A test result that was meant to confirm the territory’s first presumptive case of COVID-19 has come back negative. The sample was sent to a public health lab in Ontario because the testing equipment used initially was not accredited by Health Canada. While the case is still considered a presumptive positive due to the initial tests, the affected individuals and all close contacts are now out of isolation. The government is setting up two machines that can confirm diagnoses of COVID-19 in the territory. The new machines would mean the territory no longer has to send samples to the provinces for confirmation, and would drastically increase testing capacity. Once the devices are set up and approved by Health Canada, the government said it would revisit the requirement that all those entering the territory self-isolate for 14 days. Nunavut has extended its public health emergency order until July 23.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The territorial government announced that it had its first presumptive case of COVID-19: a person working at the Mary River mine on Baffin Island. The individual is from outside the territory, and all known contacts of the person are now in isolation. No workers at the facility are from Nunavut, and operations at the mine will continue as usual. Confirmation of the positive test is expected to arrive this week. Nunavut had previously announced a presumptive case in April, but the test result turned out to be a false positive. The government has said that the positive test will not affect the territory’s reopening plan, and there is no risk of infection for Nunavut community members. The outdoor gathering limit was increased to 50 people on June 29. Some indoor facilities can have up to 50% capacity or 50 people, whichever number is lower.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nunavut lifted various lockdown restrictions this week, allowing bars and restaurants to open at 50% capacity, personal care services to resume, and theatres and churches to reopen. There will be no formal limit on the number of people a person can socialize with at bars or restaurants, though the territory’s Chief Public Health Officer continues to advise that social distancing regulations remain in place. Additionally, the government announced that youth activities may resume on June 29, and some long-term care facilities may permit visitors. Although residents of Nunavut may travel to the Yukon on July 1, the territorial government will mandate that travellers quarantine for two weeks upon their return.</p>
