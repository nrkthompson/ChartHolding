      Following a steady decline in new cases over the past two weeks, Israel has continued to amend emergency regulations to enable further reopening. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, clubs, swimming pools, and hotels will be opened. Extracurricular activities will also be allowed. Museums are being permitted to open without interactive activities involving direct contact. Events in open areas are allowed to be held, and up to 50 people can attend mass gatherings. Students are currently alternating between in-person and remote teaching. A school will be closed if any confirmed case is discovered. Physical distancing, wearing masks, and practising hygiene remain the key principles for relaxation.
