      On May 15th, the PM announced the reopening of beaches, effective June 6th, with an adherence to the 1.5 metre distance rule within groups, booking of deck-chairs, and restrictions on group beach sports. Downloading of an app was also encouraged by the PM, which updates the beach-goers on the availability of  space at their beach of choice. The app will use real-time mobile data and numbers registered by beach businesses to establish an estimate of the number of people present at a beach, during a particular time. Followed by the stability in the number of  COVID-19 cases in Portugal, the Government also moved onto its second phase of deflation, effective May 18th, under which restaurants, cafes, and pastry shops, are now allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Terraces and street shops of up to 400 square metres, are allowed to reopen along with tourist establishments and local accommodations, with the ability to offer drinks and catering services to the public. High school students and day care centres reopened with new rules, such as the obligatory testing of all daycare workers, and the mandatory application of masks by all secondary school students. Visits to elderly homes with prior appointments are also permitted under authorisation, with the number of visits allowed per week limited to one 90 minute meeting. Museums across the country also reopened with on-site and online exhibitions and initiatives, with  safety standards such as the use of masks and social distancing measures as a prerequisite.
