      Effective June 15, masks are no longer mandatory in shops, schools and tourist areas. Face coverings remain mandatory on public transit, in health facilities and for contact services where social distancing is difficult to maintain. While Austrian borders have been open to neighbouring countries since June 4, as of June 16 this extended to all EU countries, except the UK, Sweden, Spain and Portugal. Despite reopening the Austria-Germany border, federal police will continue to control the border for immigration and criminal activity. Exhibitions, conventions, trade fairs and large meetings can resume across the country, allowing the event industry to resume operations.
