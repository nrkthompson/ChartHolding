      The Lithuanian government has continued to ease lockdown restrictions after receiving praise from the international community for its domestic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective May 25th, all primary schools and post-secondary institutions are being allowed to reopen and hold in-person classes if they are unable to do so remotely, while secondary schools will be allowed to reopen on May 30th. Effective May 30th, indoor and outdoor high-performance athletic competitions will be allowed to take place without the presence of spectators, while private celebrations will be allowed to take place in public venues with up to 30 guests. Most international flights to and from Lithuania remain grounded, with the exception of flights between Vilnius, Frankfurt (Germany), and Riga (Latvia), which have been allowed since May 13th and May 18th respectively, and regular flights between Vilnius, Oslo (Norway), and Tallinn (Estonia), which were allowed to resume on May 25th. All Lithuanian residents above the age of 6 are still required to cover their face and nose in public places and adhere to physical distancing guidelines. The Office of the Lithuanian Government held a video conference on May 21st called “COVID-19: Lithuania’s Response,” prompted by “a marked increase in international interest in Lithuania’s best practices combating the virus, and in particular, the early efforts that helped the three Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) reopen their internal borders.
