      Michigan Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, extended a stay-home order through to  June 12th. A coalition of barber shops, salons, and spas came together and presented an eight-step reopening plan to the Governor, asking her to lift the ban on their businesses. A few malls in Metro Detroit reopened on May 28th, following the Governor's executive order allowing retail stores to reopen, providing they only let only 10 customers in at a time. Illinois will enter Phase 3 of its reopening plan on May 29th, allowing  manufacturing, offices, retail, barbershops, and salons to reopen with capacity and safety precautions. Gatherings are limited to 10 people or fewer. Face coverings in public are required, and bars and restaurants are only open for pickup and delivery. Maine is experiencing an increase in hospitalizations in certain counties, prompting Governor Janet Mills to postpone Phase 2 of the state's reopening plan. Other counties will continue reopening on June 2, with restaurants offering dine-in services, and fitness centers and nail salons opening. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order that will allow private businesses to deny entry to customers who are not wearing a mask or face covering. The vast majority of regions in the state have made it to phase one of reopening; the only region outstanding at this point is New York City, the hardest-hit region in the state and country. Some parks in NYC have drawn circles to allow people to maintain social distance, a strategy which the City of Toronto has adopted.
