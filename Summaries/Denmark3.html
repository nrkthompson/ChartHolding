      On June 15, the Foreign Minister of Denmark announced that Danes who travel to Iceland, Norway or Germany may return without self-isolating as long as they did not visit cities with populations larger than 750,000. Since Iceland and Norway do not have cities of that size, this restriction only applies to arrivals from Germany. Although travel advisories regarding all other countries are a recommendation and are not mandatory, they are expected to remain in place until August 31. Tourists from Iceland, Norway and Germany will be allowed into Denmark if they show proof that they have lodging booked for a minimum six night stay outside of Copenhagen and will be randomly asked to submit to an optional COVID-19 test. New guidelines on gatherings are expected to be released next week and anticipated to permit gatherings with 30-50 people. Opposition parties are pushing for the higher end of the spectrum to allow for more events.
