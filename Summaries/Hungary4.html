      The Hungarian government has continued easing restrictions related to COVID-19, after its Chief Medical Officer declared that the country has successfully overcome the first wave of the pandemic. All catering establishments are being permitted to serve and seat customers indoors, and all religious services, funerals, and weddings are being allowed to take place with some restrictions. Visitation for inpatients of social institutions and long-term care homes was allowed to resume on June 3, provided that both the visitor and the inpatient are healthy, and that a distance of at least 2 metres can be maintained between them at all times. The Hungarian government has also continued easing land border restrictions with neighboring countries demonstrating favourable epidemiological situations. Since June 5, Austrian, Slovak, and Czech citizens - as well as Hungarians residing in any of these countries - have been allowed to enter Hungary without a mandatory quarantine period. On June 8, a Hungarian contact-tracing application called VirusRadar was made available for download on the iOS app store. According to the Hungarian Ministry of Innovation and Technology, the app has already been downloaded by over 30,000 Android users since it was first released in May.
