      Spain’s state of alarm is extended from June 7 to June 21, with exceptions for autonomous communities in phase 3 which will be fully governed by the presidents of those communities. As of June 1, 70% of Spain entered phase 2 of reopening, which entitles Spaniards to higher capacities for gatherings, reopening indoor dine-in restaurants, stores, professional sports without spectators, cinemas and museums with health restrictions. While Madrid remains in phase 1, the Balearic and Canary Islands entered phase 3, the final stage in Spain’s reopening plan, which includes wider movement in the region, higher capacities in shopping centres and easing other regulations. On June 8, autonomous governments can recommend the phase of reopening where they think they should be to the federal government. On June 1 and 2, Spain did not report any COVID-19 related deaths, however, there have been reports of autonomous communities still reporting deaths. A judge found the Aragonese government and its public health agencies guilty of knowing the extent of the danger COVID-19 posed in January and not acting accordingly. The sentence given reflects the case’s origin as a labour lawsuit.
