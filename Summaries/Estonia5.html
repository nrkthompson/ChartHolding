      Estonia will lift its lockdown restrictions on nightclubs and bars on July 1. They will be limited to 50% capacity and a maximum of 100 people, and must adhere to disinfectant requirements. Additionally, the government announced that social distancing measures will become optional, effective immediately. In the interim, the Health Board has initiated criminal proceedings against the owners of multiple nightclubs in Tallinn after they were found to be hosting large parties under false pretenses, despite not being allowed to operate until July. After a brief spike in the number of new cases last week, the infection rate has returned to where it was in the month before the rise in cases. The Head of the Health Board Merike Jürilo has resigned following numerous public disagreements with the government’s Minister of Social Affairs and criticism of her handling of the response to the pandemic.
