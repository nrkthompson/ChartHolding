      All of Santiago is now under quarantine due to a recent uptick in cases; this is an expansion of the country’s earlier strategy to use dynamic or selective quarantines, as opposed to quarantining entire cities. Further restrictions were imposed on quarantined regions, including Santiago, where people now have five permits to go outside weekly, only two of which can be used on the supermarket. Children cannot go between their parents’ households, if they live separately, and there will be no more permits to change addresses. Approximately 33,000 people have been detained for violating curfews and approximately 1,401 people have been detained for violating health restrictions. As of May 21st, Chile registered its highest number of daily deaths at 45. Chile received more ventilators from Holland and China. The use of hyperimmune plasma treatment, which uses antibodies from a recovered patient to treat someone who is still ill, had its first success in Chile at curing a COVID-19 patient. Chilean officials expressed that they do not want to relax restrictions until there is a  consistent two to three week long drop in cases and instead will focus on increasing treatment capacity. Clashes between protestors and police erupted over food shortages in Santiago.
