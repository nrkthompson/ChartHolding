      This week, the 4-day average reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Germany decreased to 0.89. Most sectors in Germany have reopened with additional hygiene measures. On June 15, the tourism sector will reopen on allowing European travelers in the country without quarantine. Moreover, it will allow Germans to travel to other countries if the infection rate in destination countries is below 50 per 100,000 people per week. Chancellor Angela Merkel says the governing coalition has agreed on a €130 billion stimulus package to help revive the virus-hit economy. The measures include temporarily cutting value-added taxes from 19% to 16%, providing families with an additional €300 per child and doubling a government-supported rebate on electric car purchases. The package also establishes a €50 billion fund for addressing climate change, innovation and digitization within the German economy. Doctors in Germany are seeing a problematic drop in patients with serious health conditions seeking medical help, for fear of contracting COVID-19 in the clinics. Furthermore, thousands of protestors defied the gatherings ban in Berlin on June 2, after George Floyd's death last week in the US.
