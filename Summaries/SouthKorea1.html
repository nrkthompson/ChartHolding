      Following a series of outbreaks associated with nightclubs and hospitals, South Korea has been carrying out a robust epidemiological investigation into these outbreaks, and implementing control measures to suppress a possible resurgence. People are being urged to stay vigilant and avoid visiting indoor places where close physical contact is likely. To strengthen monitoring, additional diagnostic tests will be provided to nursing homes and mental hospitals. High school seniors returned to in-person classes on May 18, while all other students will resume classes gradually according to regional and school conditions. Fever tests will be conducted at least twice a day - once before entering a classroom, and again at midday - and suspicious symptoms will be checked frequently. Both students and teachers are required to wear masks at all times. A school will be shut and teaching will be switched to the online system if a confirmed case is identified. Restrictive measures on non-essential activities have mostly been lifted. “Distancing in Daily Life” remains the standard: two arms’ distancing, personal hygiene, frequent ventilation and disinfection, social connection, and staying home if feeling unwell.
