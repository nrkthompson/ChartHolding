  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After Service New Brunswick reopened all of its service centres this week, they reminded customers who visit a service centre in person to keep at least two metres of distance between one another, and to wear a mask if that distance cannot be maintained. All zones in New Brunswick remain in the “yellow” level of the province’s phased recovery plan.Movement to the “green” level will not occur until a vaccine has become available. As of July 13, the province has gone 3 consecutive days without reporting any new cases of COVID-19.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 3, travel within the Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador) will be permitted without the requirement to self-isolate for Atlantic Canada residents. Canadians residing outside of Atlantic Canada must self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving in New Brunswick - unless they have already self-isolated in another Atlantic province, in which case they may enter the province without self-isolating again. On July 1, Service New Brunswick announced that it would reopen all of its 33 service centres by July 13, while urging residents to continue using online or telephone services where possible. All zones in New Brunswick remain in the “yellow” level of the province’s phased recovery plan. Movement to the “green” level will not occur until a vaccine has become available.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick’s phased recovery plan has four levels - red, orange, yellow, and green - with movement between levels occurring based on the rate of new infections. On June 26, New Brunswick’s Campbellton region (Zone 5) moved into the yellow level with the rest of the province, having previously stayed in the orange level as other zones reopened more extensively. This means that outdoor gatherings can now take place in uncontrolled venues with up to 50 participants, and religious services can be held indoors with appropriate measures in place. Most commercial, retail, recreational, and professional services or businesses, including swimming pools, water parks, yoga studios, bowling alleys and restaurants, can reopen unless otherwise specified. Non-regulated health professionals/businesses and other personal service businesses, such as barbers and tattoo parlours, can also reopen. Casinos, bars, cinemas, and performance venues reopened on June 26 in all of the province’s seven zones. Movement to the green level will not occur until a vaccine has become available.</p>
