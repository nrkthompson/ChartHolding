  <p>
      New Brunswick’s phased recovery plan has four levels - red, orange, yellow, and green - with movement between levels occurring based on the rate of new infections. On June 26, New Brunswick’s Campbellton region (Zone 5) moved into the yellow level with the rest of the province, having previously stayed in the orange level as other zones reopened more extensively. This means that outdoor gatherings can now take place in uncontrolled venues with up to 50 participants, and religious services can be held indoors with appropriate measures in place. Most commercial, retail, recreational, and professional services or businesses, including swimming pools, water parks, yoga studios, bowling alleys and restaurants, can reopen unless otherwise specified. Non-regulated health professionals/businesses and other personal service businesses, such as barbers and tattoo parlours, can also reopen. Casinos, bars, cinemas, and performance venues reopened on June 26 in all of the province’s seven zones. Movement to the green level will not occur until a vaccine has become available.
