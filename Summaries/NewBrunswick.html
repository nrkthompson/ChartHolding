  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick reported a total of 65 active cases of COVID-19 on December 14, down from 81 a week ago. Zone 2 (St. John) was moved back to the less restrictive “yellow” alert level on December 10 -- despite having the highest number of active cases in the province (33). At the yellow level, residents are permitted to hold private indoor gatherings of up to 20 people. Meanwhile, Zone 4 (Edmundston) has been moved to the “orange” level after an outbreak at a local hospital. The region had 15 active cases as of December 13, seven of which were healthcare workers at the Edmundston Regional Hospital. At the orange level, residents are restricted to a single-household bubble, and masks are required in most public places. The province has confirmed that 1,950 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine arrived in New Brunswick on December 14. A second shipment is expected before the end of 2020.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick reported a total of 81 active cases on December 7, down from 119 one week ago. As of December 7, Zones 1 (Moncton) and 3 (Fredericton) have been moved back to the “yellow” alert level along with most of the province. Zone 2 (St. John) remains at the “orange” level due to the higher number of active cases and risk of transmission in the region. At the yellow alert level, masks are required mainly in public, indoor spaces, while orange-level restrictions mandate the use of masks in both indoor and outdoor settings. Additional orange-level restrictions include a limit of 50 participants for outdoor gatherings.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick reported 18 new cases on November 29, leaving the province with a total of 119 active cases as of November 30 -- up from 77 the week before. The recent surge in infections prompted the province to move Moncton and Saint John back to the “orange” alert level last week, followed by Fredericton on November 26. Public Health New Brunswick recommended the increase restrictions due to high numbers of social interactions, multiple exposure settings including schools, pubs, gyms, health facilities and sports clubs, and significant population interaction across regions. Nursing homes in the province’s three orange zones are now starting to restrict visitors, hoping to reduce the risk of an outbreak. Fredericton’s York Care Centre, for instance, has barred normal visitors from the facility until the region returns to the “yellow” level.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick reported a single-day record of 23 new cases of COVID-19 on November 21, leaving the province with a total of 77 active cases as of November 23. This surge in cases has prompted the provincial government to move Zones 1 (Moncton) and 2 (Saint John), where the majority of active cases have been reported, back to the “orange” alert level. This means that the spread of COVID-19 is no longer considered “stable” in these parts of the province and that some minor restrictions and public health guidelines are needed to reduce pressure on the healthcare system -- including the limitation of personal contacts to a single-household bubble, travelling only when essential, and the enforcement of strict hygienic regimes in public places and venues. These changes come just one week after New Brunswick began allowing people from outside of Canada to enter the province to visit immediate family members.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick reported 6 new cases of COVID-19 on November 14, the province’s largest single-day increase since September -- and another 3 the following day, leaving the province with a total of 22 active cases. Most of the province’s active cases remain in the Fredericton and Campbellton regions, each of which has six active cases as of November 16. The entire province is currently at the “yellow” alert level, which includes the reopening of most personal services, fitness facilities, casinos, cinemas and large performance venues under strict hygienic regimes and limits on capacity. New Brunswick also loosened its travel restrictions on November 13, aligning its entry rules with federal standards. People from around the world can now enter New Brunswick in order to visit immediate family members, a privilege which had previously been limited to Canadian citizens and permanent residents.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick’s Fredericton region reported one new case on November 8, bringing the province’s total active cases to 24 -- down from 35 active cases on November 1. Most of the province’s active cases are now located in the Fredericton region, which has 11 active cases as of November 8. With just 9 active cases (25 fewer than last week), the Campbellton region has moved back to the “yellow” recovery phase along with the rest of the province. Yellow-level restrictions include the reopening of most personal services, gyms, fitness facilities, casinos, cinemas and large performance venues under strict hygienic regimes and limits on capacity. Indoor and outdoor gatherings in yellow-level regions can take place with up to 50 people.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick reported one new case of COVID-19 on November 1, bringing the province’s total active cases up to 35. Most of the province’s active cases are still located in the Campbellton region, which has 23 active cases as of November 2. As a result, the Campbellton region has remained in the “orange phase,” while Moncton has been moved back to the “yellow phase.” Orange-level restrictions include the closure of all personal services, gyms, fitness facilities, casinos, cinemas and large performance venues. Outdoor gatherings in orange-level regions must be limited to 10 people or fewer, while some indoor events, including weddings, funerals and religious services, will be permitted with 10 or fewer.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Two New Brunswick residents died from COVID-19 on October 25, bringing the province’s total number of COVID-related deaths up to six. Residents of the Campbellton region are currently being asked to limit their contacts to a single-household bubble, and to wear masks at all times in public places, subject to enforceable fines. More than half of New Brunswick's active cases are now located in the Campbellton region. The Moncton and Campbellton regions were forced back to the more restrictive “orange phase” two weeks ago. This includes the closure of all personal services, gyms, fitness facilities, casinos, cinemas and large performance venues. Outdoor gatherings in orange-level regions must be limited to 10 people or fewer, while some indoor events, including weddings, funerals and religious services, will be permitted with 10 or fewer people.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick reported its third death from COVID-19 on October 17. Five new confirmed cases were reported by Public Health on the following day, bringing the province’s total up to 104 active cases. More than half of New Brunswick's active cases are now located in the Campbellton region. It's been more than a week since the Moncton and Campbellton regions were forced back to the more restrictive “orange phase;” this phase requires masks for all students in grades K-12 at schools in these regions. Additional orange-level restrictions include the closure of all personal services - such as barbers, spas, and hairstylists - as well as gyms, fitness facilities, casinos, cinemas and large performance venues. Outdoor gatherings in orange-level regions must be limited to 10 people or fewer, while some indoor events, including weddings, funerals and religious services, will be permitted with 10 or fewer people.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government of New Brunswick reported six new cases of COVID-19 on October 12, bringing the province’s number of active cases up to an all-time high of 76. The Moncton and Campbellton regions were forced back to the “orange” recovery phase on October 9 due to recent local outbreaks. This means that mask use is now required, both indoors and outdoors, for all students in grades K-12 at schools in these regions. Additional orange-level restrictions include the closure of all personal services, including: barbers, spas, hairstylists, gyms, fitness facilities, recreational centres, casinos, cinemas and large performance venues. Outdoor gatherings in orange-level regions must be limited to 10 people or fewer, while some indoor events, including weddings, funerals and religious services, will be permitted with 10 or fewer attendees. Public Health New Brunswick has said that anyone who has recently travelled to an orange-level region should observe all orange-level requirements for 14 days after returning home.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick reported one new case of COVID-19 on October 3, and currently has 3 active cases.Public Health New Brunswick has released a series of guidelines for participating in fall activities safely, with special attention given to Thanksgiving and Halloween. New Brunswickers are encouraged to hold small Thanksgiving gatherings this year, and to hold them outside if possible. Those planning to participate in Halloween activities are encouraged to sanitize their hands between visits, keep high-touch areas such as door handles and railings clean, and consider offering non-food treats such as stickers or coloured pencils. There is no indication that the province will impose any compulsory restrictions on Thanksgiving gatherings or trick-or-treating activity. Premier Blaine Higgs has also reminded New Brunswickers that using face masks continues to be mandatory in public whenever safe physical distancing is not possible, and that failing to comply with the province’s emergency order could lead to a provincial mandatory mask policy being implemented as soon as October 8.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick is reimposing travel restrictions on residents of Quebec's southern Gaspe area, which has seen its COVID-19 alert level rise in recent weeks. New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs announced that only residents of the Listuguj First Nation and Pointe-a-la-Croix would be allowed to make day trips into New Brunswick effective September 25. These changes follow last week's decision to reimpose travel restrictions on residents of Quebec's Temiscouata region, who were previously part of New Brunswick's government travel bubble and were permitted to take day trips in the province without restrictions. Residents of southern Gaspe and Temiscouata are still permitted to make day trips into New Brunswick for essential purposes such as medical appointments, approved work and child custody arrangements.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The province currently has one active case of COVID-19. Universities across New Brunswick are reviewing policies that would allow them to take disciplinary action against students who violate COVID-19 regulations. The RCMP would typically be responsible for disciplining off-campus student behaviour, but these policy changes would make the possibility of university discipline available if deemed necessary. Mount Allison University, for example, has said that if a studentís off-campus behaviour is found to put the universityís community at risk, then disciplinary action would fall within the scope of the schoolís updated code.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ahead of New Brunswickís election later this month ñ the first to take place in Canada since the start of the pandemic ñ voters are turning out in high numbers to advanced polling stations, eager to avoid long lines during a pandemic. A New Brunswick resident from the Edmundston†health region has tested positive for COVID-19 while in Quebec, according to the provincial government. The individual was staying in Quebec†before they were symptomatic and will remain there until recovered, Public Health said in a release Thursday. New Brunswick has added the confirmed case to its overall tally, which is now 193. There have been 188 recoveries and two deaths in the province since the onset of the pandemic.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs called an election on August 17 to take place on September 14, making it the first major vote to be held in Canada since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the provinceís electoral agency has tweaked its mail-in voting procedures so that they can be used to serve vulnerable individuals ñ primarily those residing in hospitals and long-term care homes ñ who would normally require special on-site polling locations. The agency is also preparing for an increase in mail-in votes, requesting more supplies and staff than normal in light of the changed circumstances.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick announced its plan for the upcoming school year, which is focused on traditional methods of in-person teaching--with hygienic protocols in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Students of all ages will be asked to bring a clean face mask to school with them every day, which they will be required to wear in hallways, common areas, and at assemblies. Students will not be required to wear their masks inside the classroom while working with other students--as long as a safe physical distance can be maintained. In addition to mask protocols, class sizes will be reduced where necessary in order to ensure that students are able to maintain a safe distance from each other.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The province of New Brunswick reported four new cases of COVID-19 on August 4, and two new cases on August 6.  All 6 of these have been attributed to a group of temporary migrant workers arriving in Moncton who tested positive for the virus during their mandatory quarantine period. As of August 10, they are the only active cases in the province.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 4, there were no active cases of COVID-19 in the province of New Brunswick for a second straight day, according to the Government of New Brunswick's COVID-19 Dashboard.

As of July 25, New Brunswick had reported five consecutive days without any new cases of COVID-19. Three active cases remain in the province.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The mayors of Sackville, New Brunswick, and Amherst, Nova Scotia, have requested a meeting with New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs to discuss concerns over delays and confusion at the provincesí shared border. These concerns are primarily related to inconsistencies over what is required from Canadians looking to travel between the provinces. Uncertainty over wait times at the border have made it difficult for essential travellers and workers to plan their commutes accordingly, with some choosing to stay at home rather than go to work. Meanwhile, the Government of New Brunswick is reportedly considering reopening two of its border crossings with Quebecís Avignon and Temiscouata regions, whose residents would not have to self-isolate upon entering New Brunswick.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After Service New Brunswick reopened all of its service centres this week, they reminded customers who visit a service centre in person to keep at least two metres of distance between one another, and to wear a mask if that distance cannot be maintained.

As of July 13, the province has gone 3 consecutive days without reporting any new cases of COVID-19.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 3, travel within the Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador) will be permitted without the requirement to self-isolate for Atlantic Canada residents. Canadians residing outside of Atlantic Canada must self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving in New Brunswick - unless they have already self-isolated in another Atlantic province, in which case they may enter the province without self-isolating again. On July 1, Service New Brunswick announced that it would reopen all of its 33 service centres by July 13, while urging residents to continue using online or telephone services where possible. All zones in New Brunswick remain in the ìyellowî level of the provinceís phased recovery plan. Movement to the ìgreenî level will not occur until a vaccine has become available.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswickís phased recovery plan has four levels - red, orange, yellow, and green - with movement between levels occurring based on the rate of new infections. On June 26, New Brunswickís Campbellton region (Zone 5) moved into the yellow level with the rest of the province, having previously stayed in the orange level as other zones reopened more extensively. This means that outdoor gatherings can now take place in uncontrolled venues with up to 50 participants, and religious services can be held indoors with appropriate measures in place.
