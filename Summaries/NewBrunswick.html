  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs called an election on August 17 to take place on September 14, making it the first major vote to be held in Canada since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the province’s electoral agency has tweaked its mail-in voting procedures so that they can be used to serve vulnerable individuals – primarily those residing in hospitals and long-term care homes – who would normally require special on-site polling locations. The agency is also preparing for an increase in mail-in votes, requesting more supplies and staff than normal in light of the changed circumstances.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick announced its plan for the upcoming school year, which is focused on traditional methods of in-person teaching--with hygienic protocols in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Students of all ages will be asked to bring a clean face mask to school with them every day, which they will be required to wear in hallways, common areas, and at assemblies. Students will not be required to wear their masks inside the classroom while working with other students--as long as a safe physical distance can be maintained. In addition to mask protocols, class sizes will be reduced where necessary in order to ensure that students are able to maintain a safe distance from each other.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The province of New Brunswick reported four new cases of COVID-19 on August 4, and two new cases on August 6.  All 6 of these have been attributed to a group of temporary migrant workers arriving in Moncton who tested positive for the virus during their mandatory quarantine period. As of August 10, they are the only active cases in the province.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 4, there were no active cases of COVID-19 in the province of New Brunswick for a second straight day, according to the Government of New Brunswick's COVID-19 Dashboard. No new cases of the respiratory disease have been reported in the province for 15 days. Prior to Monday, there were still two active cases--both in the Fredericton region. Both people have recovered.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs has identified August 1 as the province’s target date for reopening its borders for day trips to and from Quebec’s Avignon and Temiscouata regions. As of July 25, New Brunswick had reported five consecutive days without any new cases of COVID-19. Three active cases remain in the province.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The mayors of Sackville, New Brunswick, and Amherst, Nova Scotia, have requested a meeting with New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs to discuss concerns over delays and confusion at the provinces’ shared border. These concerns are primarily related to inconsistencies over what is required from Canadians looking to travel between the provinces. Uncertainty over wait times at the border have made it difficult for essential travellers and workers to plan their commutes accordingly, with some choosing to stay at home rather than go to work. Meanwhile, the Government of New Brunswick is reportedly considering reopening two of its border crossings with Quebec’s Avignon and Temiscouata regions, whose residents would not have to self-isolate upon entering New Brunswick.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After Service New Brunswick reopened all of its service centres this week, they reminded customers who visit a service centre in person to keep at least two metres of distance between one another, and to wear a mask if that distance cannot be maintained. All zones in New Brunswick remain in the “yellow” level of the province’s phased recovery plan.Movement to the “green” level will not occur until a vaccine has become available. As of July 13, the province has gone 3 consecutive days without reporting any new cases of COVID-19.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 3, travel within the Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador) will be permitted without the requirement to self-isolate for Atlantic Canada residents. Canadians residing outside of Atlantic Canada must self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving in New Brunswick - unless they have already self-isolated in another Atlantic province, in which case they may enter the province without self-isolating again. On July 1, Service New Brunswick announced that it would reopen all of its 33 service centres by July 13, while urging residents to continue using online or telephone services where possible. All zones in New Brunswick remain in the “yellow” level of the province’s phased recovery plan. Movement to the “green” level will not occur until a vaccine has become available.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Brunswick’s phased recovery plan has four levels - red, orange, yellow, and green - with movement between levels occurring based on the rate of new infections. On June 26, New Brunswick’s Campbellton region (Zone 5) moved into the yellow level with the rest of the province, having previously stayed in the orange level as other zones reopened more extensively. This means that outdoor gatherings can now take place in uncontrolled venues with up to 50 participants, and religious services can be held indoors with appropriate measures in place. Most commercial, retail, recreational, and professional services or businesses, including swimming pools, water parks, yoga studios, bowling alleys and restaurants, can reopen unless otherwise specified. Non-regulated health professionals/businesses and other personal service businesses, such as barbers and tattoo parlours, can also reopen. Casinos, bars, cinemas, and performance venues reopened on June 26 in all of the province’s seven zones. Movement to the green level will not occur until a vaccine has become available.</p>
