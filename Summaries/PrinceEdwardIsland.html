  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The province has adopted a new COVID-19 alert system with three levels: new normal, caution, and restricted. These levels will be used to describe the current set of restrictions in place and are subject to changes.

The chief public health officer warned citizens about a potential second wave, but COVID-19 cases remain low.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Prince Edward Island remains in Phase 4 of their reopening plan.

  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Prince Edward Island remains in Phase 4 of their reopening plan. “Public health officials reversed an earlier decision and approved a plan that will allow UPEI and Holland College to co-host a varsity soccer league during the fall term for men’s and women’s teams.” In terms of economic recovery, the province is slightly ahead of the rest of Canada. Unemployment in the province is mostly in tourism-related industries. However, some farmers are concerned that CERB is worsening the ongoing labour shortage in the province.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Prince Edward Island remains in Stage 4, with a low number of daily cases. In the province, primary and secondary schools have reopened.

Students and staff at UPEI will be required to wear non-medical masks inside all campus buildings.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Prince Edward Island remains in Stage 4 with a plan to ease measures to a new normal by early October. A new normal in the province would include fewer restrictions on sports and recreation activities and increased capacity limits for restaurants. Overall, the future reopening of the province will be contingent on low rates of community infection. The province announced that it will be increasing its limits on public gatherings to 150 people effective immediately. Up to 3 cohorts of 50 people can attend events as long as there is an approved plan that addresses physical distancing. This increase will allow more people to attend worship services, concerts, and sporting events. Singing is now permitted at these events if performers remain at a 2 metre distance from each other and wear a mask. MLAs on the Standing Committee on Health want the government to address several issues before the possible arrival of a second wave in the province. The Committee’s priorities include how the start of the school year could influence testing capability and when the government will roll out the mobile mental health crisis units.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Prince Edward Island remains in Phase 4 of its reopening plan. Public schools will return to full time, in class learning on September 8. The government’s plan includes several safety measures such as physical distancing, staggered recess times, and cohort classes. The province announced that additional staffing resources will be provided to allow for increased cleaning measures and to address learning gaps for students impacted by COVID-19. All 56 individual school plans that fall under the Public Schools Branch in the province are available online. The government has outlined its plans for post-secondary students arriving from outside the Atlantic bubble. International students arriving from other countries must quarantine in designated hotels and will be tested on day 10-12. All students from outside the bubble will require pre-travel approval to enter the province. Health PEI is hiring additional staff for numerous health-care service roles in order to prepare for a second wave of COVID-19.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Prince Edward Island has no active cases. The province is working with UPEI and Holland College to determine best practices for September as Canadian and international students arrive from outside the Atlantic bubble. 300 soccer players, coaches, staff, and media from the Canadian Premier League arrived in the province. Players were in self-isolation prior to their arrival and are now in their own bubble for the duration. Parks Canada is adapting its services to better adhere to public health and safety measures. Campsites are operating at 40% capacity and are not accepting walk-in campers. Fewer washroom services are available and are being cleaned every 2 hours.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In P.E.I, the Chief Public Health Officer is not prepared to make non-medical masks mandatory but strongly recommends wearing them in public. The province is now allowing family members who live outside of the Atlantic bubble to apply for pre-approved recreational travel in order to visit the island. To qualify, family members must be Canadian citizens or have permanent residency status, and must fill out a declaration form prior to their arrival. The Canadian Premier League will play its shortened COVID-19 soccer season in Charlottetown beginning August 13. Farmers in the province are in need of more labourers as there are not enough temporary foreign workers arriving due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Data from Prince Edward Island suggests that the increase in infections in the 20-29 age group is likely due to COVID-19 fatigue across the country, prompting young people to visit bars and beaches. Premier Dennis King emphasized that he is in no hurry to expand the Atlantic bubble and allow visitors from elsewhere in Canada without requiring them to self-isolate for 14 days. Due to concerns about family reunification, Premier King said that provincial officials are considering how to resolve these issues while still respecting the 14-day requirement. School officials continue to work on reopening plans, including issues such as staggering arrival and departure times, mask requirements, and bus transportation. The government is focused on reopening long-term care homes to more visits from relatives. Although still in its initial stages, the plan could involve designating loved ones as essential care providers or allowing residents to go on drives or visits with family.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New cases in Prince Edward Island could delay further easing of border restrictions. Contact tracing efforts have shown that the latest cases are not connected to the Atlantic bubble. The premier said the government will not begin to consider encouraging broader travel beyond the regional bubble before August. Twenty-six public libraries will reopen on July 20 for grab-and-go book services. Movie theatres in Charlottetown will begin reopening on July 17 with social distancing, capacity limits, mask recommendations, and other measures in place. Theatres in other areas of the province will open in the coming weeks. The government strongly recommends wearing masks in indoor public spaces when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Small businesses are responding by setting protocols for employees, seeking suppliers, and offering discounts to mask-wearing customers.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A day after the Atlantic bubble opened, PEI announced it had its first new cases of COVID-19 in months. The premier of PEI believes the outbreak might have been prevented if Canada Border Services had better communication with the Maritime provinces. PEI officials have not connected the outbreak to the Atlantic bubble, but will consider closing the bubble in order to protect public health. The Opposition is calling on the province to create a memorandum of understanding that outlines shared responsibilities among the Atlantic provinces related to COVID-19 and the regional bubble. In the province, borders remain closed to non-essential travellers from abroad. After the education minister released plans for returning back to school in the fall, a Liberal MLA criticized the lack of information provided in the plan.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Prince Edward Island is currently in Phase 4 of their reopening strategy, which is intended as the final phase of reopening. The Atlantic bubble came into effect on July 3, allowing residents in the region to travel without quarantine requirements. Visitors to PEI will be required to submit an online declaration form before their departure and undergo health screenings upon arrival. Residents of PEI returning from other provinces in the region will not need to submit a declaration form but will be subject to a health screening. A group of restaurants has drafted a formal request to public health officials to ease COVID-19 restrictions to allow for more customers in their establishments. The group wants to see full capacity in its restaurants, and table sizes increased from 6 to 10 guests, similar to that in Nova Scotia. The Minister of Education released additional details about the school curriculum in the fall. An in-school model is preferred but plans are in place for at-home learning. Increased cleaning procedures are being planned for school rooms and buses. Students will likely work in small cohorts with screening protocols for people entering the school to be outlined later on. The government continues to develop an operational plan that will acknowledge the need to hire more teachers, cleaning staff, and bus drivers to ensure compliance with the new social distancing and sanitary measures.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Phase 4 of Prince Edward Island’s reopening strategy came into effect on June 26. Larger organized gatherings of up to 50 people indoors or outdoors are permitted given physical distancing requirements are met and an operational plan is in place. This applies for gatherings such as organized sports, worship services, day camps, and weddings. Personal gathering is limited to 15 people indoors and 20 people outdoors. Recreational facilities are allowed to reopen including pools, recreation centres, gyms, and campgrounds. In the province, retail businesses, libraries, and salons have reopened. Indoor dining at eateries has resumed but only 50 people can sit inside with additional people permitted on an outdoor patio. In PEI, home based learning continues with youth centres, child care centres, and day camps reopening. Details of the September 2020 school year will be outlined in the next few weeks. Opposition leader Peter Bevan-Baker is questioning how quickly the province is allowing seasonal residents from Ontario and Quebec to come into PEI. Despite the initial plan to begin with Atlantic Canada, western Canada, and then central Canada, already 850 applications have been approved. Atlantic premiers have committed to a regional travel bubble without the need to self-isolate, but anyone coming from outside the Atlantic provinces is required to self-isolate.</p>
