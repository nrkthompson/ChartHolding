      Phase 4 of Prince Edward Islandâ€™s reopening strategy came into effect on June 26. Larger organized gatherings of up to 50 people indoors or outdoors are permitted given physical distancing requirements are met and an operational plan is in place. This applies for gatherings such as organized sports, worship services, day camps, and weddings. Personal gathering is limited to 15 people indoors and 20 people outdoors. Recreational facilities are allowed to reopen including pools, recreation centres, gyms, and campgrounds. In the province, retail businesses, libraries, and salons have reopened. Indoor dining at eateries has resumed but only 50 people can sit inside with additional people permitted on an outdoor patio. In PEI, home based learning continues with youth centres, child care centres, and day camps reopening. Details of the September 2020 school year will be outlined in the next few weeks. Opposition leader Peter Bevan-Baker is questioning how quickly the province is allowing seasonal residents from Ontario and Quebec to come into PEI. Despite the initial plan to begin with Atlantic Canada, western Canada, and then central Canada, already 850 applications have been approved. Atlantic premiers have committed to a regional travel bubble without the need to self-isolate, but anyone coming from outside the Atlantic provinces is required to self-isolate.
