  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Data from Prince Edward Island suggests that the increase in infections in the 20-29 age group is likely due to COVID-19 fatigue across the country, prompting young people to visit bars and beaches. Premier Dennis King emphasized that he is in no hurry to expand the Atlantic bubble and allow visitors from elsewhere in Canada without requiring them to self-isolate for 14 days. Due to concerns about family reunification, Premier King said that provincial officials are considering how to resolve these issues while still respecting the 14-day requirement. School officials continue to work on reopening plans, including issues such as staggering arrival and departure times, mask requirements, and bus transportation. The government is focused on reopening long-term care homes to more visits from relatives. Although still in its initial stages, the plan could involve designating loved ones as essential care providers or allowing residents to go on drives or visits with family.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New cases in Prince Edward Island could delay further easing of border restrictions. Contact tracing efforts have shown that the latest cases are not connected to the Atlantic bubble. The premier said the government will not begin to consider encouraging broader travel beyond the regional bubble before August. Twenty-six public libraries will reopen on July 20 for grab-and-go book services. Movie theatres in Charlottetown will begin reopening on July 17 with social distancing, capacity limits, mask recommendations, and other measures in place. Theatres in other areas of the province will open in the coming weeks. The government strongly recommends wearing masks in indoor public spaces when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Small businesses are responding by setting protocols for employees, seeking suppliers, and offering discounts to mask-wearing customers.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A day after the Atlantic bubble opened, PEI announced it had its first new cases of COVID-19 in months. The premier of PEI believes the outbreak might have been prevented if Canada Border Services had better communication with the Maritime provinces. PEI officials have not connected the outbreak to the Atlantic bubble, but will consider closing the bubble in order to protect public health. The Opposition is calling on the province to create a memorandum of understanding that outlines shared responsibilities among the Atlantic provinces related to COVID-19 and the regional bubble. In the province, borders remain closed to non-essential travellers from abroad. After the education minister released plans for returning back to school in the fall, a Liberal MLA criticized the lack of information provided in the plan.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Prince Edward Island is currently in Phase 4 of their reopening strategy, which is intended as the final phase of reopening. The Atlantic bubble came into effect on July 3, allowing residents in the region to travel without quarantine requirements. Visitors to PEI will be required to submit an online declaration form before their departure and undergo health screenings upon arrival. Residents of PEI returning from other provinces in the region will not need to submit a declaration form but will be subject to a health screening. A group of restaurants has drafted a formal request to public health officials to ease COVID-19 restrictions to allow for more customers in their establishments. The group wants to see full capacity in its restaurants, and table sizes increased from 6 to 10 guests, similar to that in Nova Scotia. The Minister of Education released additional details about the school curriculum in the fall. An in-school model is preferred but plans are in place for at-home learning. Increased cleaning procedures are being planned for school rooms and buses. Students will likely work in small cohorts with screening protocols for people entering the school to be outlined later on. The government continues to develop an operational plan that will acknowledge the need to hire more teachers, cleaning staff, and bus drivers to ensure compliance with the new social distancing and sanitary measures.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Phase 4 of Prince Edward Islandâ€™s reopening strategy came into effect on June 26. Larger organized gatherings of up to 50 people indoors or outdoors are permitted given physical distancing requirements are met and an operational plan is in place. This applies for gatherings such as organized sports, worship services, day camps, and weddings. Personal gathering is limited to 15 people indoors and 20 people outdoors. Recreational facilities are allowed to reopen including pools, recreation centres, gyms, and campgrounds. In the province, retail businesses, libraries, and salons have reopened. Indoor dining at eateries has resumed but only 50 people can sit inside with additional people permitted on an outdoor patio. In PEI, home based learning continues with youth centres, child care centres, and day camps reopening. Details of the September 2020 school year will be outlined in the next few weeks. Opposition leader Peter Bevan-Baker is questioning how quickly the province is allowing seasonal residents from Ontario and Quebec to come into PEI. Despite the initial plan to begin with Atlantic Canada, western Canada, and then central Canada, already 850 applications have been approved. Atlantic premiers have committed to a regional travel bubble without the need to self-isolate, but anyone coming from outside the Atlantic provinces is required to self-isolate.</p>
