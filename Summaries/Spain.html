  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 22, reports indicated that -- of the autonomous communities -- Aragon had the biggest increase in daily cases, with Navarre surpassing Catalonia for second place two days in a row. In response to the increasing threat, the Pamplona neighborhood of Menillori in Navarre regressed to phase two of the federal government's original reopening plan ,which had officially ended with the state of alarm on June 21. Phase two limits store, bar and restaurant capacity, reduces hours in entertainment venues and limits gatherings to ten. Similarly, Catalonia will be closing late night bars and clubs for two weeks. Reports indicate that the increase in cases in Gandia, Valencia can be associated with nightlife in the area. Similarly, the outbreaks in Navarre are believed to relate to nightlife and around 93% of cases in the area were found among people aged 17 to 28. Some Spanish officials believe that Spain may be experiencing a second wave now. Spanish health authorities are concerned about the connection of new cases to parties and clubs. With more younger people getting COVID-19, reports indicate that instead of burdening hospitals, the increasing presence of the disease in young people is stressing primary healthcare centers. Spanish health authorities said that, with the exception of Catalan in Lleida, hospitals are experiencing low stress. In most public places in Spain, masks are mandatory -- with exceptions including Madrid and the Canary Islands.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over recent weeks, all 17 regions in Spain, with the exception of Asturias, reported new hotspots. In Catalonia, the county Segria was recently reported as the most dangerous part of the country for COVID-19. Despite Segria having been cordoned for approximately one week, the numbers of cases and hospitalizations are increasing. While Catalonia attempted to issue a stay-home order, it was dismissed by a judge. Approximately 70% of the cases in Spain are asymptomatic, do not needed hospitalization, and are found using contact tracing. Although Aragon had the most new cases as of July 15, Catalonia had the second highest and was a bigger concern because of community transmission. As of June 13, approximately 15 Spanish provinces saw increases of COVID-19 cases; the majority of these places did not see the same type of virus in Spain’s first wave in February and March. On July 15, the army mobilized to help in Aragon and address an outbreak in Huesca where the military may have to help house asymptomatic seasonal workers who test positive. Increasing parts of Spain are requiring or intend to require masks. The cities of Zaragoza and Huesca in the autonomous community of Aragon have regressed to a flexible phase two. The flexible phase two is described as: remaining open to other parts of Spain; closing clubs; reducing capacities for weddings, funerals, restaurants and public spaces; and reducing gathering limits to 10. A University of Cambridge research team has reported that, among the OECD, Spain managed COVID-19 the worst based on indicators like the contagion rate, controlling the spread and the mortality rate.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In response to a rise in cases, the Spanish government will meet to discuss further potential lockdown measures. Although there are differences across regions, there are still nationwide regulations on large events and capacity limits. With some exceptions, Extremadura, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands have made masks mandatory regardless of social distancing and reports suggest that Cantabria, Asturias and Aragon may also do so. On July 4, Segria in Lleida in Catalonia entered lockdown again for 15 days with the possibility of an extension. Prior to the lockdown, non-residents were advised to leave and residents were advised to return by a specified time. Due to the roadblock regulations, people would only be able to enter or leave for work purposes; however, gatherings of up to ten people and some other activities are permitted amid the lockdown.  In Galicia, restrictions were introduced again and between July 5 and July 10, people were only allowed to enter and leave A Marina for work. As of July 10, Asturias and La Rioja were the only states that had not reported another outbreak. Aragon has the second-most COVID-19 cases. Madrid has the most new cases. Basque Country has ordered PCR tests for all patrons who visited a specific bar in the Ordizia district. Despite the restrictions, Spaniards voted in regional elections in Basque Country and Galicia with mail-in votes or delegates voting for COVID-19 patients. In reopening, the Balearic Islands have faced many large parties that violate health regulations.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A county in Galicia was placed under lockdown for fear of a COVID-19 outbreak. On July 3, Madrid declared another outbreak. On July 1, the Spanish-Portuguese border reopened. Although approved by the EU Council, Spain will not admit Chinese and Moroccan tourists until the countries open their borders to Spanish visitors. Spain opened their borders to 13 countries outside the EU and Schengen region, including Canada. Spain expanded their list of exempt travellers. As of July 1, Spain eliminated travel restrictions and quarantines for people from the EU, the Schengen area, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino, and the Vatican, but did require passenger location cards and temperature checks. UK travellers will need to submit a health declaration and will be given a QR code upon arrival to allow the government to trace visitors during their stay. Spain reopened non-essential businesses, eateries, bars, hotels and personal care facilities with appointments when people wear masks. Radar Covid, Spain’s COVID-19 contact tracing app is being tested in three phases in the Canary Islands; phase 1 will conduct promotion and training, phase 2 will simulate outbreaks in three waves on July 10, 13 and 17, and phase 3 on July 20 will analyze downloads, the number of positive cases and the number of users. Madrid’s progression to new normality will be in two phases; during the week of July 1, Madrid was in phase 1 and on July 6 it enters phase 2, which is the new normality. The new normality includes: wearing face masks until there is a vaccine; regulations for workplaces, hotels and stores; and requiring regional governments to remain prepared with PCR testing, ICU facilities, and isolation facilities to accommodate spikes in cases.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Autonomous communities increased diagnostic capabilities and PCR test rates. From June 29 to July 13, the Canary Islands will test Spain’s contact tracing app. The voluntary app is aimed at discouraging a second wave, complements manual tracking and considers privacy concerns. Spain hopes that a minimum of 2800 to 3000 residents download the app. If successful, the app will launch across Spain in September. On June 21, Spain’s state of alarm and mobility restrictions ended. On June 28, over 100 international flights from the European Schengen area, except Portugal, will enter the country and there will be 225 domestic flights. On July 1 Moroccan visitors may enter. Airport precautions include: 1) documents proving a COVID-19 test has been passed, 2) temperature checks, and 3) visual inspections. Separate procedures exist for passengers who fail any of the controls. British travelers may enter without quarantining. Spain’s new normal includes capacity limits at beaches, bars, terraces, and swimming pools and may use apps, track wifi signal access, and use GPS or use bluetooth to track and limit crowds. Different areas of Spain have released different plans for large gatherings at festivals.  These vary from allowing them as of July 1 to allowing them in September; some areas have not released any plans. Madrid will have two phases for a new normal; phase 1 began June 21 with capacity limits at bars, restaurants, pools and shopping centres and continues until July 6, which marks the beginning of their final phase where clubs will reopen with restrictions. There have been outbreaks in Basque country since reopening without indication of community transmission. The Spanish government is preparing a strategic reserve of materials in the event of spikes in cases. The government is also considering transfers, loans, digital transformation, training and science in their recovery plan as proposed by the European Commission.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Schools in Spain remain closed, but some schools are testing new norms for the fall in voluntary classes. The tests include checking for masks and fevers at the gate, increased hand washing, disinfecting chairs and desks, and social distancing with and without masks. By June 15, 70% of Spain entered phase 3. Spain’s new normality is expected to begin June 21, although Galicia has already entered the new normality. Some sanitary measures implemented early in the outbreak remain. As of June 21, tourism will reopen to European and Schengen travellers, who must be nationals of the countries they arrive from, with the exception of Portugal whose travellers are not permitted until July. Tourists will only be permitted to visit parts of Spain in phase 3 and with infection rates of less than nine per 100,000 people. These tourists will not have to quarantine, but must stay for minimum five days and prove their return trip. Other regions will still require a 14 day quarantine. The remainder of Spain is anticipated to reopen to tourism in July as the lockdown eases. Andalucia wants to create a health passport for foreigners, both for tourists and immigrants, and to collect health tests and PCR test results from tourists and visitors. Federally and in Valencia and the Canary Islands, there are concerns about people entering the country through irregular immigration and enforcing testing and isolation in those cases.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 9, Spain reported 86 new COVID-19 cases, double that from the day before, but overall Spain is experiencing a steady decrease in cases. Spain’s final state of alarm is from June 7 to 21, following which autonomous communities in phase 3 will be governed by the governments in that region. Madrid will remain in phase 2 of reopening. On June 15, open air bullrings can resume with capacity limits, and in phase 3 clubs, bars, casinos and game halls will reopen with restrictions. Spain’s new norm which will begin in phase 3 for each region requires masks and social distancing, but will introduce free movement within Spain. On July 1, foreign tourists may enter, and in the meantime hotels will be cleaned and new procedures will explore video sensors, barriers and apps to control crowds and distancing. When schools resume in September, classes will have 15-20 students and health guidelines which include social distancing. In Barcelona, Nissan workers protested a plant's closure, and in Madrid protests occurred over the death of black American George Floyd. The International Criminal Court is investigating a complaint against Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez on behalf of the Spanish Association of Affected and Victims of Covid-19. Their claims are based on government delays in the response to COVID-19, the lack of PPE for medical personnel and staff shortages in nursing homes.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Spain’s state of alarm is extended from June 7 to June 21, with exceptions for autonomous communities in phase 3 which will be fully governed by the presidents of those communities. As of June 1, 70% of Spain entered phase 2 of reopening, which entitles Spaniards to higher capacities for gatherings, reopening indoor dine-in restaurants, stores, professional sports without spectators, cinemas and museums with health restrictions. While Madrid remains in phase 1, the Balearic and Canary Islands entered phase 3, the final stage in Spain’s reopening plan, which includes wider movement in the region, higher capacities in shopping centres and easing other regulations. On June 8, autonomous governments can recommend the phase of reopening where they think they should be to the federal government. On June 1 and 2, Spain did not report any COVID-19 related deaths, however, there have been reports of autonomous communities still reporting deaths. A judge found the Aragonese government and its public health agencies guilty of knowing the extent of the danger COVID-19 posed in January and not acting accordingly. The sentence given reflects the case’s origin as a labour lawsuit.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government expressed an intention to maintain their preventive isolation measures in June. Half of Spain remains in phase one, but the rest of the country progressed to phase two as of May 25th with increased social activities, work opportunities, and gatherings. With health restrictions, beaches, bars, malls, cultural locations, museums, and libraries reopened in parts of Spain. The Ministry of Health released recommendations for distancing, capacity, and cleaning practices at beaches.  On July 1st, Spain will lift their two week quarantine rule for international travelers and will begin gradually accepting international tourists. In the final phase of their reopening plan, Spain expects increased general movement and increased capacity in public spaces.  Supporters of Spain’s Vox Party organized a protest called the “Caravan for Spain and Liberty”, the protests took place in Madrid, Barcelona, and Seville in cars and on foot.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of May 21st, Spain reported their fewest daily COVID-19 deaths at 48. As of May 20th, masks are required where a 2 metre distance is not possible and are being price-controlled and made available in stores. Around May 25th, Spain will move into its next reopening phase where shopping centres, entertainment facilities, and museums will reopen under new health guidelines. The capacity of people permitted in religious places will also increase. In phase two, some regions want to limit the use of beaches and require people to make reservations to use them. By May 25th, all of Spain will be in phase one and almost half of Spain will enter phase two. Without support from the opposition, the Spanish government wants to extend their state of alarm until June 7th. Protests against the prime minister continue in Madrid.</p>
