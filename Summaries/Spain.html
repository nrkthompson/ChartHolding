  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 17, the 14-day cumulative incidence nationwide was 470.26 cases per 100,000 people. Some autonomous regions, including Valencia, Cantabria, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarre, have decided that regional borders will remain closed. Valencian officials would like to extend the closure to December 9. Madrid will close its regional borders between December 4 and 13 to limit travel during the December 7 and 8 holidays and its 12 am to 6 am curfew will remain. On November 23, bars and restaurants were permitted to reopen with a capacity limit of 30% in Catalonia. Spain’s autonomous governments will decide on the regulations to be implemented during the Christmas season. As of November 23, people visiting Spain are required to have a negative PCR test done 72 hours before departure -- or may be fined, have the test done in Spain, or be sent home. The government hopes to vaccinate all 47 million Spaniards by mid-2021. It intends to begin vaccinating in January 2021 using 13,000 vaccination sites.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 10, there were 411 new deaths and 17,395 new COVID-19 cases. This number of new daily cases is lower than last week, when the daily case numbers were in the 20,000s. EU and EEA citizens can visit Spain -- but, as of November 23, citizens from high risk EU and EEA countries must present a negative PCR test to enter the country. These high risk countries include Belgium, France, Germany, some parts of Greece, Hungary and other countries. Visitors from some other countries, like Australia and New Zealand, are also permitted into Spain. Quarantines are not mandatory for travellers, but authorities ask that visitors are residents from the approved countries, not just citizens. Spain anticipates receiving Pfizer vaccines for approximately 10 million people in April-May 2021. Central and regional governments will use medical criteria to determine vaccine priority and the government will try to promote the virus to Spaniards, some of whom are unsure about trusting the vaccine.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 6, Spain reported 22,516 new daily cases and 347 new daily deaths. This marks the most daily deaths since April. With the exception of the Canary Islands, Spain still has a curfew. Asturias’ request to close bars and impose a home confinement was denied on November 2. Castillas and Leon closed bars and restaurants and requested additional national measures on November 3. As of November 10, non-essential businesses must close by 6 pm and a curfew will run from 10 pm to 7 am in Asturias -- with the exception of Granada because it is in lockdown. Bars and restaurants are now allowed open in Madrid, with capacity limits, but must close by 11 pm. The health minister said that after two to three weeks of the current restrictions, including the national curfew and other regional restrictions, the government will be able to determine whether additional restrictions are necessary.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 30, Spain’s daily COVID-19 case count was 25,595, the highest number of daily new cases since the pandemic started; the number of new deaths was 239. The cumulative number of cases is 1,185,678 cases and 35,878 deaths. The Prime Minister said that the actual number of COVID-19 cases was probably higher than 3 million. The Spanish Parliament authorized a six-month state of alert. This will grant the federal government emergency powers to respond to the pandemic. The Spanish Canary Islands is requiring tourists to have a negative COVID-19 test to come. Several autonomous regions implemented inter-regional lockdowns to limit the spread; some regions like the Basque Country, Seville and Granada are only allowing people to enter and leave the region for essential reasons.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Spain was the first country in Europe to report more than 1 million COVID-19 cases. On October 23, Spain reported approximately 20,000 new daily cases and 231 additional deaths bringing the total deaths to approximately 34,752. On October 25, Spain declared a national state of emergency in response to the increase of cases in Spain and across Europe. The emergency imposes an overnight curfew between 11pm and 6am, with exceptions for travelling to work, purchasing medicine and caring for the elderly and children. The curfew began October 25 and will most likely continue for six months. Accordingly, the prime minister will ask Parliament to extend the state of emergency until May. Governments in autonomous regions may adjust the curfew to begin anytime between 10pm and 12am and end anytime between 5am and 7am, prevent regional travel or limit gatherings to six people from different households. The Canary Islands is excluded from the curfew.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 16, Madrid’s total number of COVID-19 cases was 283,000 and Spain’s total number of cases was 936,500. On October 16, Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants close indoor dining for two weeks to minimize social interaction and to flatten the curve. In response, some businesses have threatened to disobey the order. The cumulative 14 day number of cases in Catalonia had reached 290 per 100,000 people as of October 14 and hospitals were worried about the rise in cases. Catalonia’s R-value of transmission was 1.3, the hospital occupancy rate was 7% and the ICU rate was 19.5%. Unlike Madrid, Catalonia did not meet the criteria of having to lockdown the area where in Spain a city of more than 100,000 people must lockdown if their 14 day cumulative number of cases is over 500, their positivity rate is over 10% or their ICU occupancy is over 35%.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 9, Spain reported 890,000 cases and 50,000 deaths in total, and an average of 250 cases per 100,000 residents. Research from Polytechnic University of Catalonia reports that schools are not a significant cause of COVID-19 situation in Spain. In Andalusia and Catalonia, they had a small increase of cases in school aged children, but this could be because when there is a positive case in one child all of the children in their bubble must be tested. On October 9, a state of alarm was declared by Spain’s government for Madrid because there have been more than 600 new cases per 100,000 residents in Madrid over the last 7 days. Before the alarm, Spain’s government proposed travel and social restrictions for Madrid, but a Madrid court struck it down. However, the alarm now permits the government to enforce restrictions. The central government does not intend to influence essential work and in-person school. An opposition party, Vox, threatened to go to court claiming that the lockdown in Madrid was illegal, excessive and harmful to the economy.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Measures approved on September 30 in a meeting between the prime minister and the heads of Spain’s autonomous regions will implement restrictions in areas where they have more than 500 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents, 35% or higher COVID-19 related ICU occupancy, or where the positive COVID-19 test result rate is higher than 10%. Since the capital Madrid and nine surrounding areas meet these criteria, they were required to partially lockdown. During the lockdown, social gatherings are limited to six people, and restrictions are implemented on hotels and places of worship. People are permitted to leave home for work, school, shopping, or medical purposes, and bars and restaurants may only accommodate a seating capacity of up to 50% and must close earlier. The government for the region of Madrid wanted to maintain the 45 restrictions that they had implemented and did not want to put the city or surrounding areas on lockdown. During the meeting between the prime minister and the heads of the autonomous governments, Madrid, Catalonia, and three other regions voted against the restrictions. On September 30, regional authorities in the Balearic Islands implemented restrictions on Ibiza in response to a growing spread. Alongside suggesting people stay home, the government is limiting gatherings to five people, closing playgrounds, bars, and restaurants at 10pm. On October 3, flights between the Canary Islands and Germany resumed despite a recommendation from Berlin not to travel to Spain.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On average, the number of daily new cases is higher than it was during Spain’s peak in March; however, the daily death rates are generally lower. Spain has reported over 700,000 COVID-19 cases, leaving Spain with the most cumulative cases in Western Europe. Approximately 2,800 classes in Spain have had to quarantine because of COVID-19 cases; the education minister said that approximately 4.5% of schools have had a COVID-19 case and 0.73% of classes have had to quarantine because of COVID-19. Within the Community of Madrid, seven municipalities and six districts from the capital were designated confined areas. The government from the Community of Madrid said that there would not be a region wide lockdown, however there would be additional COVID-19 measures implemented. This decision goes against the federal government’s preference for a lockdown across Madrid. As of September 27, there were approximately 45 local lockdowns in the Madrid area, and some people from poorer neighbourhoods protested that the lockdowns were unjust. As of September 19, these localized lockdowns were implemented in areas with more than 1000 cases per 100,000 people. During localized lockdowns, people may leave home for work, school, legal or medical purposes. As of September 28, 222 national police, civil guard and military members will be deployed to help with Madrid’s COVID-19 response. Madrid’s government also wants to bolster PCR testing as a key aspect of its response.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Spainís COVID-19 situation has been on high alert since September 11 after reporting 11,370 cases and 900 hospital admissions. Madrid has been unable to stop the spread and is in a critical situation. The city has recently become Spainís COVID-19 epicenter; approximately 25% of people who get tested are COVID-19+. Consequently, Madrid may impose health restrictions and a partial lockdown. Catalonia and Aragon, which were the epicenters of the COVID-19 outbreak in July and August, have since stabilized. While Aragon has begun seeing an increase of cases, the situation in the Canary Islands, Basque Country and la Rioja have either calmed or have seen a decrease in cases. Between September 15 and 16, the COVID-19 death toll in Spain rose by 239, but authorities emphasize that the number of deaths is still fewer than in March and April. The government reports that detection rates have increased, that younger people are now contracting the virus, and that there are fewer deaths and hospitalizations. However, Spainís hospitalizations and death toll is rising. Spain's first clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine, the Janssen vaccine, began on September 14 in two Madrid hospitals. It will be tested on 190 volunteers from two groups: one group aged 18 to 55 years old and another group aged 65 years and older. The trial will last between four to six months and will be tested on people who are healthy and have not had COVID-19. Phase three will evaluate the drug and vaccineís efficacy before the vaccine is ready in one to two years. As of September 21, Madrid began a partial lockdown.  Protestors took to the streets on September 20 because many areas entering lockdown had many low income and essential workers.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Spain became the first Western European country to have more than 500,000 COVID-19 cases. It has been reported that this new wave of COVID-19 cases has a lower death rate than that during the peak in April. Reports suggest concerns with Spainís contact tracing program -- where some people who have tested COVID-19+ said that they were not contacted by contact tracers. In response to the surge in cases, Madrid is limiting social gatherings indoors and outdoors to ten people and will require bars, restaurants, weddings and funerals to implement curb service operations. Two additional Spanish towns were cordoned on September 8. Schools in Spain are reopening in September. Masks are mandatory in schools for anyone over the age of six and there must be social distancing. Some Spanish parents are concerned and have considered pretending that their child is ill in order to avoid sending them to school. Other parents are concerned that class sizes can be up to 25 students, but gatherings in some parts of the country cannot be greater than 10 people. Parents who do not send their children to school face charges and punishment for absenteeism. Spanish authorities arrested a woman who went surfing after testing COVID-19+ despite being told to quarantine. An academic pointed to multiple reasons for Spain's surge in cases: easing the COVID-19 lockdown too quickly; flawed contact tracing; a strong predisposition to gather in-person; and migrant worker living conditions that did not permit social distancing.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 18, Spainís Ministry of Health reported 2,128 new COVID-19 cases--the third highest number reported since July. As of August 19, Spain reported 3,715 new COVID-19 cases in 24 hours, a daily record since the end of Spainís lockdown near the end of June. European Union data suggests that Spain now has the most cases in Western Europe. Since the beginning of the pandemic in Spain, Catalonia and Madrid have seen the most confirmed COVID-19 cases. Spain has reported COVID-19 cases in dozens of nursing homes during this potential new wave of COVID-19. In response, some regions have limited visits to nursing homes. Nightclubs have begun closing again across Spain after the government said that they may be contributing to the resurgence in COVID-19 cases.  Basque Country declared a health emergency on August 17 and reintroduced measures such as limiting gatherings to 10 people. There were protests in Madrid against mandatory masks and restrictions on smoking in public. Protestors included anti-mask groups, anti-vaccination groups and pandemic denier groups.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 13, Spainís new daily COVID-19 infection rates were as high as those from before their lockdown ended. However, officials say that the situation is manageable. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control says Spain has an infection rate of 100 per 100,000. Between August 3 and 9, the 20-29 age group reportedly had the largest increase in positive cases. At the request of the Aragon government, the army constructed a field hospital in Zaragoza to accommodate the number of COVID-19 patients and to evaluate those with COVID-19 symptoms. As of August 11, Zaragoza was still the epicenter of the outbreak in Aragon. Some Spanish territories have reimposed earlier restrictions, such as a ban on smoking in public areas in Galicia and the Canary Islands. The government anticipates that Radar Covid, Spainís new contact tracing app, will be available nationally around September 15. While the app is still available in the Canary Islands, it is not the final version. The app does not collect personal information. In addition to informing people if they have come into contact with a COVID-19+ person, it also provides COVID-19 resources to users. Aside from Spanish, authorities intend to make the app available in other Spanish dialects like Catalan, as well as in English for tourists. In response to the increasing COVID-19 presence in Spain, Italy will carry out rapid COVID-19 testing on Spanish tourists at ports of entry and isolate them, before eventually requiring them to do another test. Belgium has prevented Belgians from traveling to certain Spanish regions; Denmark has included Spain on its red list.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New COVID-19 clusters have led Spain to become the Western European country with the most confirmed cases. The COVID-19 contact tracing app that was tested in the Canary Islands doubled the detection of suspected cases. The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are discussing the probable installation of the app during the week of August 10. The Valencian health minister announced that long term care residents in areas experiencing an increase in cases, or with health departments experiencing an increase of cases, wonít be permitted to go on outings--nor will they be allowed to accept visits from family and friends. In Cantabria, students are scheduled to return to school with no complementary activities allowed outside of school. Students over the age of five are required to wear masks; younger students are recommended to wear one. The Basque Country said that their sharp increase in cases was a second wave that resembled the outbreak in March. The Basque health minister said that a new normality was not possible and explained that the government was concerned with people going to second homes and travelling to other parts of the country. While hospitals are not yet full, Basque officials reminded people that the ability for COVID-19 to spread was still possible. Authorities suspect that COVID-19 is being spread through nightlife, terraces and in coastal areas. A Spanish Ministry of Health spokesperson said that Spain needs to prevent community transmission before September when schools and general labour interaction are set to resume.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the weekend, Spain reported approximately 8500 new cases--most of which were reported in Aragon. Four areas in Aragon have reverted to phase two of reopening. The regional government of Madrid has made masks mandatory in public places and is limiting the number of people permitted at gatherings. Madrid will also begin an information campaign that targets young people who have recently contributed to the spread of COVID-19 by resuming their social activity. In response to increasing cases in the northeastern region of Spain, the UK has banned travel to Spain and suspended flights. The Prime Minister of Spain says it is a mistake because the increase in cases is located predominantly in Catalonia and Aragon. Spain and the UK are discussing a solution. Germany has also advised Germans to refrain from visiting the Catalonia, Aragon and Navarra regions, which have recently experienced increasing cases.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 22, reports indicated that -- of the autonomous communities -- Aragon had the biggest increase in daily cases, with Navarre surpassing Catalonia for second place two days in a row. In response to the increasing threat, the Pamplona neighborhood of Menillori in Navarre regressed to phase two of the federal government's original reopening plan ,which had officially ended with the state of alarm on June 21. Phase two limits store, bar and restaurant capacity, reduces hours in entertainment venues and limits gatherings to ten. Similarly, Catalonia will be closing late night bars and clubs for two weeks. Reports indicate that the increase in cases in Gandia, Valencia can be associated with nightlife in the area. Similarly, the outbreaks in Navarre are believed to relate to nightlife and around 93% of cases in the area were found among people aged 17 to 28. Some Spanish officials believe that Spain may be experiencing a second wave now. Spanish health authorities are concerned about the connection of new cases to parties and clubs. With more younger people getting COVID-19, reports indicate that instead of burdening hospitals, the increasing presence of the disease in young people is stressing primary healthcare centers. Spanish health authorities said that, with the exception of Catalan in Lleida, hospitals are experiencing low stress. In most public places in Spain, masks are mandatory -- with exceptions including Madrid and the Canary Islands.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over recent weeks, all 17 regions in Spain, with the exception of Asturias, reported new hotspots. In Catalonia, the county Segria was recently reported as the most dangerous part of the country for COVID-19. Despite Segria having been cordoned for approximately one week, the numbers of cases and hospitalizations are increasing. While Catalonia attempted to issue a stay-home order, it was dismissed by a judge. Approximately 70% of the cases in Spain are asymptomatic, do not needed hospitalization, and are found using contact tracing. Although Aragon had the most new cases as of July 15, Catalonia had the second highest and was a bigger concern because of community transmission. As of June 13, approximately 15 Spanish provinces saw increases of COVID-19 cases; the majority of these places did not see the same type of virus in Spainís first wave in February and March. On July 15, the army mobilized to help in Aragon and address an outbreak in Huesca where the military may have to help house asymptomatic seasonal workers who test positive. Increasing parts of Spain are requiring or intend to require masks. The cities of Zaragoza and Huesca in the autonomous community of Aragon have regressed to a flexible phase two. The flexible phase two is described as: remaining open to other parts of Spain; closing clubs; reducing capacities for weddings, funerals, restaurants and public spaces; and reducing gathering limits to 10. A University of Cambridge research team has reported that, among the OECD, Spain managed COVID-19 the worst based on indicators like the contagion rate, controlling the spread and the mortality rate.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In response to a rise in cases, the Spanish government will meet to discuss further potential lockdown measures. Although there are differences across regions, there are still nationwide regulations on large events and capacity limits. With some exceptions, Extremadura, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands have made masks mandatory regardless of social distancing and reports suggest that Cantabria, Asturias and Aragon may also do so. On July 4, Segria in Lleida in Catalonia entered lockdown again for 15 days with the possibility of an extension. Prior to the lockdown, non-residents were advised to leave and residents were advised to return by a specified time. Due to the roadblock regulations, people would only be able to enter or leave for work purposes; however, gatherings of up to ten people and some other activities are permitted amid the lockdown.  In Galicia, restrictions were introduced again and between July 5 and July 10, people were only allowed to enter and leave A Marina for work. As of July 10, Asturias and La Rioja were the only states that had not reported another outbreak. Aragon has the second-most COVID-19 cases. Madrid has the most new cases. Basque Country has ordered PCR tests for all patrons who visited a specific bar in the Ordizia district. Despite the restrictions, Spaniards voted in regional elections in Basque Country and Galicia with mail-in votes or delegates voting for COVID-19 patients. In reopening, the Balearic Islands have faced many large parties that violate health regulations.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A county in Galicia was placed under lockdown for fear of a COVID-19 outbreak. On July 3, Madrid declared another outbreak. On July 1, the Spanish-Portuguese border reopened. Although approved by the EU Council, Spain will not admit Chinese and Moroccan tourists until the countries open their borders to Spanish visitors. Spain opened their borders to 13 countries outside the EU and Schengen region, including Canada. Spain expanded their list of exempt travellers. As of July 1, Spain eliminated travel restrictions and quarantines for people from the EU, the Schengen area, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino, and the Vatican, but did require passenger location cards and temperature checks. UK travellers will need to submit a health declaration and will be given a QR code upon arrival to allow the government to trace visitors during their stay. Spain reopened non-essential businesses, eateries, bars, hotels and personal care facilities with appointments when people wear masks. Radar Covid, Spainís COVID-19 contact tracing app is being tested in three phases in the Canary Islands; phase 1 will conduct promotion and training, phase 2 will simulate outbreaks in three waves on July 10, 13 and 17, and phase 3 on July 20 will analyze downloads, the number of positive cases and the number of users. Madridís progression to new normality will be in two phases; during the week of July 1, Madrid was in phase 1 and on July 6 it enters phase 2, which is the new normality. The new normality includes: wearing face masks until there is a vaccine; regulations for workplaces, hotels and stores; and requiring regional governments to remain prepared with PCR testing, ICU facilities, and isolation facilities to accommodate spikes in cases.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Autonomous communities increased diagnostic capabilities and PCR test rates. From June 29 to July 13, the Canary Islands will test Spainís contact tracing app. The voluntary app is aimed at discouraging a second wave, complements manual tracking and considers privacy concerns. Spain hopes that a minimum of 2800 to 3000 residents download the app. If successful, the app will launch across Spain in September. On June 21, Spainís state of alarm and mobility restrictions ended. On June 28, over 100 international flights from the European Schengen area, except Portugal, will enter the country and there will be 225 domestic flights. On July 1 Moroccan visitors may enter. Airport precautions include: 1) documents proving a COVID-19 test has been passed, 2) temperature checks, and 3) visual inspections. Separate procedures exist for passengers who fail any of the controls. British travelers may enter without quarantining. Spainís new normal includes capacity limits at beaches, bars, terraces, and swimming pools and may use apps, track wifi signal access, and use GPS or use bluetooth to track and limit crowds. Different areas of Spain have released different plans for large gatherings at festivals.  These vary from allowing them as of July 1 to allowing them in September; some areas have not released any plans. Madrid will have two phases for a new normal; phase 1 began June 21 with capacity limits at bars, restaurants, pools and shopping centres and continues until July 6, which marks the beginning of their final phase where clubs will reopen with restrictions. There have been outbreaks in Basque country since reopening without indication of community transmission. The Spanish government is preparing a strategic reserve of materials in the event of spikes in cases. The government is also considering transfers, loans, digital transformation, training and science in their recovery plan as proposed by the European Commission.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Schools in Spain remain closed, but some schools are testing new norms for the fall in voluntary classes. The tests include checking for masks and fevers at the gate, increased hand washing, disinfecting chairs and desks, and social distancing with and without masks. By June 15, 70% of Spain entered phase 3. Spainís new normality is expected to begin June 21, although Galicia has already entered the new normality. Some sanitary measures implemented early in the outbreak remain. As of June 21, tourism will reopen to European and Schengen travellers, who must be nationals of the countries they arrive from, with the exception of Portugal whose travellers are not permitted until July. Tourists will only be permitted to visit parts of Spain in phase 3 and with infection rates of less than nine per 100,000 people. These tourists will not have to quarantine, but must stay for minimum five days and prove their return trip. Other regions will still require a 14 day quarantine. The remainder of Spain is anticipated to reopen to tourism in July as the lockdown eases. Andalucia wants to create a health passport for foreigners, both for tourists and immigrants, and to collect health tests and PCR test results from tourists and visitors. Federally and in Valencia and the Canary Islands, there are concerns about people entering the country through irregular immigration and enforcing testing and isolation in those cases.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 9, Spain reported 86 new COVID-19 cases, double that from the day before, but overall Spain is experiencing a steady decrease in cases. Spainís final state of alarm is from June 7 to 21, following which autonomous communities in phase 3 will be governed by the governments in that region. Madrid will remain in phase 2 of reopening. On June 15, open air bullrings can resume with capacity limits, and in phase 3 clubs, bars, casinos and game halls will reopen with restrictions. Spainís new norm which will begin in phase 3 for each region requires masks and social distancing, but will introduce free movement within Spain. On July 1, foreign tourists may enter, and in the meantime hotels will be cleaned and new procedures will explore video sensors, barriers and apps to control crowds and distancing. When schools resume in September, classes will have 15-20 students and health guidelines which include social distancing. In Barcelona, Nissan workers protested a plant's closure, and in Madrid protests occurred over the death of black American George Floyd. The International Criminal Court is investigating a complaint against Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez on behalf of the Spanish Association of Affected and Victims of Covid-19. Their claims are based on government delays in the response to COVID-19, the lack of PPE for medical personnel and staff shortages in nursing homes.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Spainís state of alarm is extended from June 7 to June 21, with exceptions for autonomous communities in phase 3 which will be fully governed by the presidents of those communities. As of June 1, 70% of Spain entered phase 2 of reopening, which entitles Spaniards to higher capacities for gatherings, reopening indoor dine-in restaurants, stores, professional sports without spectators, cinemas and museums with health restrictions. While Madrid remains in phase 1, the Balearic and Canary Islands entered phase 3, the final stage in Spainís reopening plan, which includes wider movement in the region, higher capacities in shopping centres and easing other regulations. On June 8, autonomous governments can recommend the phase of reopening where they think they should be to the federal government. On June 1 and 2, Spain did not report any COVID-19 related deaths, however, there have been reports of autonomous communities still reporting deaths. A judge found the Aragonese government and its public health agencies guilty of knowing the extent of the danger COVID-19 posed in January and not acting accordingly. The sentence given reflects the caseís origin as a labour lawsuit.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government expressed an intention to maintain their preventive isolation measures in June. Half of Spain remains in phase one, but the rest of the country progressed to phase two as of May 25th with increased social activities, work opportunities, and gatherings. With health restrictions, beaches, bars, malls, cultural locations, museums, and libraries reopened in parts of Spain. The Ministry of Health released recommendations for distancing, capacity, and cleaning practices at beaches.  On July 1st, Spain will lift their two week quarantine rule for international travelers and will begin gradually accepting international tourists. In the final phase of their reopening plan, Spain expects increased general movement and increased capacity in public spaces.  Supporters of Spainís Vox Party organized a protest called the ìCaravan for Spain and Libertyî, the protests took place in Madrid, Barcelona, and Seville in cars and on foot.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of May 21st, Spain reported their fewest daily COVID-19 deaths at 48. As of May 20th, masks are required where a 2 metre distance is not possible and are being price-controlled and made available in stores. Around May 25th, Spain will move into its next reopening phase where shopping centres, entertainment facilities, and museums will reopen under new health guidelines. The capacity of people permitted in religious places will also increase. In phase two, some regions want to limit the use of beaches and require people to make reservations to use them. By May 25th, all of Spain will be in phase one and almost half of Spain will enter phase two. Without support from the opposition, the Spanish government wants to extend their state of alarm until June 7th. Protests against the prime minister continue in Madrid.</p>
