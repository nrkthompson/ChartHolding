      Even though Germany has logged less than 500 daily cases for the past week, Chancellor Angela Merkel claims that Germany is still at the beginning of the pandemic. Roughly half of the country's 30,000 ICU beds are vacant, prompting certain states to accept patients from Russia. Many of the country’s shops, museums, bars, and restaurants have reopened, with physical distancing and hygiene guidelines. Cinemas, gyms, pools, and beer gardens have begun opening in certain states. Masks are compulsory on public transport and in shops. Although the federal government had a more unified approach while locking down the economy in March, each state is now adopting unilateral steps to loosen restrictions, creating a patchwork of wildly varying rules on physical distancing within the country. For example, the Premier of Baden-Württemberg announced on May 26th that his state would allow seated public events with up to 100 people from June 1st. Social distancing rules remain in place throughout the federation throughout June. Germany has been praised for its effective contact-tracing strategy, which is low-tech and relies on information given by the COVID positive patient. "Contact-tracers" conduct 15 minute phone calls with recently diagnosed patients, and ask about their movements and close interactions within the last 48 hours. A Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll has found that more than seven out of ten Germans view Merkel's performance positively, with roughly two-thirds agreeing that the health impacts of COVID-19 outweigh the economic impacts. Merkel has the highest approval rating amongst EU leaders. Nevertheless, protests against the sustained lockdown measures continue to take place every Saturday, with thousands protesting last weekend.
