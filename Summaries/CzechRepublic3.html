      On May 25, the Czech government proceeded to the fourth and final phase of its reopening plan, allowing all catering establishments, hotels, spas and public swimming pools to resume. Mass gatherings of up to 300 people are permitted in both indoor and outdoor settings, while professional and amateur athletes are allowed to organize training with up to 300 participants. Groups of up to 15 primary school students are permitted to meet to participate in optional group activities, hobbies and clubs. Some post-secondary classes and group activities are also being allowed to take place in-person, provided that there are no more than 15 students together in one room. All hospitals, walk-in clinics, and social therapy workshops have reopened for Czech residents under the age of 50, with the possibility of visits to social and medical in-patient facilities. On June 3, the Czech-Slovak border reopened, allowing citizens from both countries to travel across the border without restrictions.Other activities and businesses are expected to resume throughout June depending on the country’s ongoing epidemiological situation. Most Czech residents travelling outside of their homes are still required to cover their faces using a scarf or mask until further notice.
