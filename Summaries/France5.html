      COVID-19 fatalities and hospitalizations decreased in France this week, but the number of active cases increased with confirmed cases outpacing recoveries. Nevertheless on June 15, President Emmanuel Macron announced that all of mainland France is now in the so-called "green zone," including the Paris region. Accordingly, cafés and restaurants in Paris were allowed to reopen on June 15, along with some cultural institutions such as the Versailles Palace. On June 15, France's border with other EU states reopened while borders with countries outside the bloc "where the epidemic has been controlled" will reopen on July 1. Only travelers from Spain and the UK are required to self-isolate for two weeks, in parallel with current regulations in those two countries. The contact tracing app in France may not be able to connect with others across the EU because it stores data centrally; moreover, only 2% of the population (1.5 million people) has downloaded and activated the app, which was launched on June 2. Most surprisingly, Macron announced that every preschooler and pupil under the age of 16 will be required to go back to school on June 22 in mainland France. On June 16, a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the government's response to the COVID crisis was opened. This inquiry has extended powers of investigation, where its summons are legally compulsory, its hearings are held under oath, and its members can carry out document checks for the next six months.
