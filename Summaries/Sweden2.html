      Officials in the Skåne region have outlined their plan to increase the amount of testing in the region by offering tests to those working in non-healthcare essential services, and to those who require medical treatment of any kind, even if they do not need to go to the hospital. The Minister of Health Lena Hallengren is facing criticism after nearly 5000 fewer people were tested last week than the week before, and the country is still significantly below its testing capacity of 100,000. Hallengren has said that it was naive to place that high of a testing goal, and she acknowledged the logistical challenges that have made it so difficult to reach. In a separate interview, Hallengren said that she believes that Swedes have largely been following the government’s recommendations, but acknowledged the high number of infections in long-term care homes. Opposition parties have scheduled debates in Parliament over the government’s handling of the situation in long-term care homes, after previously supporting the government’s strategy.
