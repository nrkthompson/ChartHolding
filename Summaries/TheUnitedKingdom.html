  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The UK has reported more than 1,000 new COVID cases each day for the past week. Nevertheless, PM Johnson moved forward with the government’s reopening plan on August 15. Indoor theatre, music and performance venues can now reopen with socially distanced audiences; indoor wedding receptions for up to 30 guests is permitted; casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and soft play centres can reopen; and "close contact" beauty services such as facials, eyebrow threading, eyelash treatments, makeup application and microblading will resume. England’s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, said that England has "probably reached the limits" of how open it can be given the number of COVID-19 cases in the country. School plans are still vague at this point, but critics are worried about the opening of bars and schools simultaneously. Government sources do not believe that the issue is a zero-sum game and that both sectors can open with proper precautions.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">For the first time since June, the UK reported more than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases on August 9. Manchester will likely remain in lockdown until next week. On August 9, Prime Minister Johnson wrote that there is a "moral duty" to get all children in England back to school in September. Scientists, however, warn that the country could be placed ‘right back’ in nationwide lockdown if the government does not improve its track and trace system by the time schools reopen. Currently, patients who test positive for COVID-19 get a phone call regarding their results and instructions on how to self-isolate. The UK does not have a contact-tracing app; the nations within the UK are developing their own, such as Northern Ireland’s StopCovid NI. Gyms, pools and play centres in Wales reopened on August 10; businesses are legally required to ensure people maintain a two-metre distance and to provide hygiene stations where appropriate. After pausing his government’s reopening plan on August 1, Johnson announced that indoor performances, casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks, and close contact services will not resume until August 15.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The UK’s seven-day moving average continues to increase--with 928 reported cases as of August 3. A major incident has been declared in the Manchester area, allowing the creation of a “central command structure” to help tackle the rising number of COVID cases. On July 30, Health Secretary Matt Hancock reintroduced lockdown measures in parts of northern England, barring households from visiting one another. This is the UK’s second regional restriction. The first one, in Leicester, ended on August 3--allowing restaurants, pubs, shops and hairdressers to reopen more than a month after they were closed. PM Boris Johnson called off plans to allow venues, including casinos, bowling alleys and skating rinks, to open from August 1. Wedding receptions were also put on hold, along with plans to allow limited numbers of fans back into sports stadiums and audiences into theatres. Scientists have warned that current testing and contact tracing is inadequate to prevent a second wave after schools in the UK reopen in early September (August 11 in Scotland).</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">COVID-19 metrics remain stable in the UK. The average number of daily new cases is approximately 650. Nevertheless, the government will pause reporting COVID-19 deaths briefly in order to review its methodology. New rules on wearing masks in England came into effect on July 24; people entering shops, banks and supermarkets now required to wear face coverings. People can be fined as much as 100 pounds ($171 CAD) by police if they refuse. Places like restaurants, pubs, gyms and hairdressers are exempted. This weekend, indoor gyms, leisure centres and pools reopened across England. Indoor gyms have also reopened in Northern Ireland, but they remain closed in Scotland and Wales -- with no date yet given for when this might change. The UK has re-added Spain to the list of countries where travellers must quarantine upon return.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With more than 45,000 deaths related to COVID, the UK is reviewing potentially faulty COVID-19 death data coming out of England, where anyone who had COVID and died from a non-COVID event (i.e. heart attack) months later is still considered dying from COVID. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would not impose a second national lockdown in the event of another outbreak; instead, local councils in England have been given a raft of “lightning” lockdown powers. The UK government is set to roll out speedy finger-prick antibody tests after conducting ‘secret’ human trials, which demonstrated a 98.6% success rate. The lockdown of the Leicester region has been lifted, after an outbreak was contained. Activity day-camps have either not opened or cut the number of places they offer by more than a half to adhere to government guidance that they keep children in “small consistent groups of no more than 15 children.” Many parents have criticized the government for not opening up more childcare opportunities.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new cases continues to hover around 600-900 daily in the United Kingdom. After a steep reopening last week, PM Boris Johnson's government is opening the economy even further. As of July 12, beauty salons, spas, tattoo parlours and nail bars are welcoming back clients. Some treatments, such as eyebrow threading, are still banned. In Scotland, indoor shopping centres are allowed to reopen on July 12, with hair salons, barbershops, indoor pubs, cafes and restaurants following suit on July 15. With regard to face coverings, PM Johnson had previously indicated that the government may be considering tougher rule, which are currently compulsory only on public transport in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, opinion on this is divided among his cabinet ministers, with some ministers prefering a "common sense" approach over a compulsory one. On July 12, Amnesty International reported that the UK has the highest number per capita of health and social care worker deaths during the pandemic, with at least 540 frontline staff dying after contracting the virus in England and Wales. Leicester remains in lockdown after a rise in cases there. Health Minister Matt Hancock said this will be reviewed later this week. After introducing a 14-day quarantine measure for travellers last month, the UK released a “travel corridor” list on July 10. Travellers to England from countries on this list would not be required to quarantine. Notably, Canada is not on this list of exempted countries.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The UK’s COVID warning rating was downgraded on July 3 from four to three. Under this stage, the virus is now known as “generally circulating” and therefore calls for a “gradual easing in controls” to further relieve the lockdown. On July 4, gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions in England began. Pubs and restaurants can open for indoor dining. Libraries, cinemas and museums can reopen, along with spas and hair/nail salons. Tattoo parlors and gyms remain closed. Gatherings of up to 30 people will be allowed anywhere in England, except Leicester which is in lockdown after an outbreak was detected last week. Religious ceremonies may resume. Physical distancing rules have been halved to 1m between people. Scientists are worried that the government is reopening the economy too fast and that a track-and-trace system meant to quickly stamp out any outbreaks is not fully functional. However, the four nations of the U.K. are moving at different speeds in terms of reopening. The restrictions in England, with a population of around 56 million, have been mostly lifted, triggering concerns that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being unduly influenced by a desire to kickstart Britain's ailing economy. The UK began lifting the 14-day quarantine requirement for travelers visiting from 73 countries. Canada is not on the quarantine-free list, even though its cumulative cases per capita is lower than some of the other countries on the list.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Reuters tally, the United Kingdom's suspected COVID-19 death toll has hit 54,089, based on death certificates where COVID-19 was mentioned as the cause in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, the government tally is lower because it only includes those who had a COVID+ diagnosis before dying. The UK's COVID-19 alert level has been downgraded from four to three. Under this level, the virus is considered to be "in general circulation" so there could be a "gradual relaxation of restrictions". Although beaches had already reopened three weeks ago, on June 25 tens of thousands of people flocked to two beaches in Dorset and Brighton on the hottest day of the year. The crowds prompted local officials to declare it a "major incident" and considered closing beaches again. This week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that England is on its way to reopening on July 4, which will see the social distancing two metre rule scrapped in order to allow smaller businesses to open. Nightclubs, indoor gyms and swimming pools are expected to stay closed, with more information to be released next week.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The UK's COVID-19 death toll has surpassed 53,000. Watchdogs and authorities are using the number of excess deaths, which is currently double the average number of deaths last year, as a method for measuring the full impact of the COVID-19 crisis directly and indirectly. Unlike most countries, the UK is not tracking the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19. This has made public health experts question the effectiveness of contact tracing, since they do not know who has recovered. The Government is abandoning the COVID-19 app it developed in May, and will now subscribe to the Apple-Google model, which recognizes 99% of smartphones. This U-turn has caused the official opposition to question how much money was spent on the original app. On June 15, "non-essential" retailers - those selling fashion, toys and books, among other items - reopened across England. Hygienic restrictions are in place, such as a limit on the number of customers allowed in each store, discouraging customers from unnecessarily touching merchandise and closing fitting rooms. Without tourists, businesses expect to see around 10 to 15% of its normal customer base this week. Non-essential retail stores in Scotland and Wales have not opened. Plans to reopen eateries by July 4 might be delayed. President Macron will not have to quarantine for 14 days when he travels to London on June 18 to meet with Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the 80th anniversary of the French Resistance and post-Brexit discussions.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 9, the Office for National Statistics said that about 64,000 more people than usual have died in the UK during this year's pandemic, which surpasses the kingdom’s COVID-19 death toll of 52,000. According to Neil Ferguson, a senior scientist who was advising the government in March, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the UK could have been halved, if the government had introduced the lockdown one week earlier. PM Johnson is facing increased backlash due to Ferguson’s testimony. Additionally, the government’s unpopular two-week quarantine on international arrivals was established on June 8, with experts saying it’s too late and hence too ineffective, as it will devastate tourism. British Airways, along with  over 500 tourism and hospitality companies, have come together under the title “Quash Quarantine” and are deciding how best to combat the rules including potential legal action. According to an OECD report, Britain’s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the crisis out of all high-income countries with a projected slump in the UK’s national income of 11.5%. Although most sectors in the UK remain closed, non-essential retail outlets are expected to reopen on June 15, with a range of social distancing and protective measures. Johnson is planning to scrap the two metres distancing rule by September at the latest for schools to reopen fully for the start of the new school year.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 3, the country's death toll surpassed 50,000, putting it behind the US. While experts agree that the peak has passed, the UK still has one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. Nevertheless on June 1, some non-essential businesses, including car showrooms and garden centres, resumed operations. Restaurants and most schools across the Kingdom remain closed with no confirmed date for reopening. Although primary schools were permitted to reopen in England on June 1, only a fifth of schools actually did so with severely low attendance rates. Retail stores are scheduled to reopen on June 15. The contact-tracing app has not launched yet. Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed plans for a mandatory 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK, which will take effect on June 8. The government was criticized by opposition parties for imposing the quarantine period on new arrivals now because they claim that it would have been more effective earlier in the pandemic, and that at this point it could further damage the tourism and airline sectors. Low-cost carrier, RyanAir, called the policy “utterly ineffective” because travellers could still take public transportation home from the airport and go to grocery stores. Notably, the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance did not support the decision. He claims that travel quarantines are effective only when infection rates inside a country have dropped, and when applied to travelers arriving from countries with high rates of transmission. Vallance says this is currently not the case for the UK. While the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland must abide by the quarantine, they will set their own enforcement approaches.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The UK is still in its lockdown phase. Unlike most European countries, the UK is still reporting over 2,000 cases and hundreds of deaths daily. At this time, people across the UK must remain in their houses, unless they are shopping for essential needs or exercising. PM Johnson's government is focusing on building a new track-and-trace system prior to reopening the economy. The system uses Bluetooth tracing to inform the user whether or not they have been in close contact with another user who has tested positive. The at-risk user will be encouraged to stay at home for two weeks, and be given statutory sick pay. The launch date is not yet announced, but the country's Test and Trace Chief confirmed the system will not be fully operational at a local level until the end of June, four weeks after lockdown restrictions are eased. This has prompted opposition politicians to call the strategy "high risk." Moreover, scientists have warned that the app is not a "magic bullet" and could prevent only between 5% and 15% of infections. PM Johnson is expected to ease further restrictions next week, while Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to develop and follow their own reopening plans.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With the highest death rate in Europe, the UK is still far from reaching its daily testing capacity goal of 200,000 by the end of May in order to move ahead with reopening the country in June. To compensate for the lack of testing, Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, said on May 21st that he was confident a COVID-19 track and trace system would be operating by June 1st. The government has recruited 24,000 trackers to manually trace the contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 using telephone and email. This week, Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, revealed his plans to begin the phased reopening of schools on June 1st, beginning with students in nursery, pre-school, and primary school. He is “asking schools to adopt a number of strict protective measures” including reduced class sizes and extending testing. However, teaching unions have said the plans do not have clear, unequivocal, and adequate safety measures, and need to be halted. Some councils (equivalent to school boards) have said their schools will not open, and described the move to bring students back as "madness," vowing to defy Johnson's policies. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that schools would not reopen before August 11th, explaining that large physical spaces, such as community halls, leisure centres, and conference venues, will be used as classrooms to maintain social distancing etiquette between children. Scotland will begin easing restrictions on May 28th, almost 2 weeks after England began its reopening plan. It is worth noting that Australia is in serious talks with the UK to exempt its citizens from UK quarantine when they arrive. This lobbying effort seems to be how the globalized world is moving forward.</p>
