      The number of hospitalizations continues decreasing this week, with 11,678 patients requiring medical attention. On June 9, for the first time since March 19, the number of people in intensive care fell below 1,000, standing at 933 as of June 11.37 In the “orange zone”, which is solely the Paris area, most secondary colleges/lycées have remained shut.38 On June 25, the iconic Eiffel Tower is set to open, with a limited capacity and no elevators.39 This week, the government announced that it will end its special powers to restrict civil liberties by decree without parliamentary approval brought in to deal with the pandemic on July 10, though it will retain the ability to curb gatherings and freedom of movement for four months.40 Furthermore, the government announced €15 billion (around 22.7 billion CAD) in rescue money for the pandemic-battered aerospace industry, in hopes of saving its hundreds of thousands of jobs and keeping plane maker Airbus and national airline Air France globally competitive. In exchange for aid, however, companies will be required to invest more and more rapidly in electric, hydrogen or other lower-emission aircrafts, since France aims to make its aviation industry the cleanest in the world.41
