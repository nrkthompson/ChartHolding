      Effective June 3, Italian borders will reopen for travel to all citizens of the Schengen area without exceptions or quarantine; travel between regions will also be allowed. Italy will not open to international tourists yet but will likely filter high-risk countries based on pandemic trends and infection levels. Some hotels will reopen on June 1, depending on the number of bookings. Since May 25, gyms and swimming pools have reopened under strict hygiene and social distancing rules which include appointments, temperature checks, and the use of masks upon entering facilities. The Italian government is encouraging remote training and some regions have delayed this reopening phase until May 31. Sports teams are able to hold group training but competitive matches remain banned. The next phase is set to begin on June 3 but, Regional Affairs Minister, Francesco Boccia, said the government will not open up travel between Italian regions if mass social gatherings continue. Mayors across Italy have begun imposing new restrictions in response to crowds across the country as officials warn about the danger of a second wave of infections. The Italian government announced that 60,000 people could be employed to help enforce social distancing and the use of masks in public places but, this plan has been met with opposition.
