  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Northwest Territoriesâ€™ count of total cases has stayed at five for more than two months. The government extended its state of emergency and public health emergency until July 8. Anyone entering the territory has to self-isolate for 14 days with few exceptions. Residents of Nunavut and N.W.T. can travel freely between the territories, but both prohibit non-essential travel between the rest of Canada. The territory is in phase 2 of its reopening plan. In most cases, indoor gatherings and events can have a maximum of 25 people and a maximum of 50 people outdoors. Households with no more than five members can have five visitors at a time. Restaurants, lounges, bars and movie theatres can accommodate 25 customers. Offices may have 25 staff per floor with physical distancing measures. A total of 25 staff and clients are allowed in community and youth centres. Overnight camping is open. Outdoor tourism is possible for up to 50 people. While early learning and childcare programs are recommended to stay open, schools will be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.</p>
