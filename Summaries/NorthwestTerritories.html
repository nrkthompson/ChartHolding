  <p style="text-align:justify;">No active cases remain in the Northwest Territories. The territory’s public health authority will maintain recommendations for social distancing, despite objections from the NWT Medical Association concerning their adverse mental health effects. NWT is still at Phase 2 of its relaxing plan and is not expected to move to Phase 3 until the situation in the whole country is under control.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
