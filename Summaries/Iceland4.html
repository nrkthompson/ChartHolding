      Nurses in Iceland have voted overwhelmingly in favour of indefinite strike action from June 22 if their union is unable to come to an agreement with the government.142 As a result, numerous hospital administrators have warned the government that they will be unable to operate if their nurses go on strike, complicating the plan to open borders to tourism on June 15.143 Iceland has altered its COVID-19 testing plan for tourists, rescinding the ability of international arrivals to provide their own certificate of a negative test to avoid self-isolating. Tourists will need to be tested upon arrival, or must submit to a mandatory two-week quarantine.144 Furthermore, Iceland has announced that it will not permit tourism for people from outside the EU/EEA until restrictions to the Schengen area as a whole are clarified. Those restrictions were previously scheduled to be lifted concurrently with Icelandâ€™s, but the European Commission recently extended their duration until at least July 1.145 At the same time that border restrictions are loosened on June 15, Iceland will raise its gathering limit to 500 people (previous limit was 200).146
