  <h5>February 22, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel reported about 283 new cases of COVID-19 per 100 thousand people last week. Entering a major phase of reopening, Israel has scaled back many of its restrictions effective February 21: streetfront shops, malls, markets, museums, and libraries will be open to all Israelis; grades 5-6 and 11-12 will resume in-person classes in low-infection cities or medium-infection ones with high vaccination rates. Meanwhile, gyms, hotels, swimming pools, and sporting and culture events will be permitted to serve vaccinated people carrying the ÒGreen PassÓ, the QR-code-based certification issued by the health ministry. Starting February 19, the maximum number of people attending gatherings has been increased to 20 outdoors and to 10 indoors; houses of worship are permitted to reopen, subject to the same limits. Israel has extended the closure of its airports and land borders until March 6. On February 21, 17 municipalities, including Tel Aviv, announced that they would resume in-person classes for grades 7-10 -- in defiance of the decision made by the national government. Up until last week, over 4.2 million Israelis had received their first vaccine dose -- almost 50% of the population. However, health officials have warned of a shortfall of vaccines and have asked health providers to prioritize administering second doses in the coming two weeks. The military is launching a stepped-up drive to reach a 95% vaccination rate in particular cities and to turn them into the first immunized cities in the world.</p> 
  <h5>February 15, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel reported about 357 new cases of COVID-19 per 100 thousand people last week. The coronavirus cabinet approved a plan to partially reopen the education system on February 11, allowing kindergartens and grades 1-4 and 11-12 to open in cities with low-to-medium infection rates. Meanwhile, those grades were also reopened in cities which recorded medium-to-high rates but had vaccinated at least 70% of its residents aged 50 and up. The country’s international airport will reopen partially starting February 20, allowing in 2,000 travellers per day. However, travellers will need to obtain a negative test both upon arrival and 72 hours before their return flight to avoid quarantine. With the vaccination campaign leveling off, the health ministry and private firms are looking at different ways to incentivize Israelis to receive the vaccination. The “green passport” is still being considered: officials were reportedly thinking of blocking those who refuse to be vaccinated from accessing gyms, hotels, restaurants and cultural and sports events. The health ministry is now recommending vaccinating some teenagers aged 12-15 if they suffer from specific risk factors. The ministry has also set up a team to monitor and remove viral fake news that could hinder the vaccination campaign.</p> 
  <h5>February 8, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel reported about 517 new cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people last week. People can now travel beyond 1,000 meters from their home. Nature reserves, national parks, heritage sites, and Israel Antiquities Authority sites will reopen to the public. Businesses that do not cater to the public can reopen. Restaurant takeaway services and businesses with individual interactions, like hairdressers, cosmeticians and barbers will be allowed to operate. Vacation rentals can serve single families. The country’s major international airport will remain closed until at least February 20. As of February 7, no decision has been made by the government on the reopening of the education system. With the pace of the mass vaccination campaign slowing down, Israel opened vaccination to anyone over the age of 16.</p> 
  <h5>February 1, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel reported about 508 new cases of COVID-19 per 100 thousand people in the last week, with a very high positivity rate of testing. After a very brief expiry at midnight on January 31, the nationwide lockdown was extended again through at least February 5. The ban on almost all international flights will remain in effect for another week. Meanwhile, a committee was set up to examine exemption requests for Israelis who need to return for humanitarian reasons during the closure. The national legislature has also passed a measure doubling fines for COVID-19 rule violators. Earlier last week, the health ministry issued a directive that supports vaccinating children under the age of 16 and at high risk of developing serious symptoms after COVID-19 infection.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel reported more than 50 new cases of COVID-19 per ten thousand people last week, with a very high test positivity rate. The national lockdown has been extended through January 31. The government has approved the near-complete shuttering of the country’s main international airport from January 26 to 31, with minor exceptions. It is also requiring a negative test undertaken within 72 hours before landing from anyone entering the country effective January 24. Meanwhile, the national legislature has allowed some top-level professional sports to resume games and training from January 29, subject to public health guidelines. Israel’s first pediatric intensive care unit for COVID-19 has opened in Jerusalem. People aged 16-18 and over 40 have now been included in the vaccination campaign. The health ministry is also advising pregnant women to get vaccinated after a number of serious cases. A military-led task force has warned that the ongoing vaccination campaign parallel to the outbreak might cause “evolutionary pressure” on the virus to mutate, and the government should be cautious about potential infections among people who have had the vaccine or the virus.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The epidemiological situation in Israel is highly concerning despite a fast-moving vaccination campaign. The number of daily new cases has been hovering around 9,000 since the middle of last week; the test positive rate is 7%. As of January 17, over 2.1 million Israelis -- 23% of the population -- have received their first shot. Second-dose vaccination has also started. A “green passport” program is being worked out so that people will be exempt from quarantine and subject to eased restrictions one week after their second dose. A stricter lockdown, which shutters all schools and non-essential businesses, is expected to be extended beyond its planned expiry on January 21. The government decided on January 17 to order arrivals from the United Arab Emirates and Brazil to quarantine in government-managed hotels; the same measures already applied to arrivals from South Africa and Zambia. To cope with the highly contagious British variant, health officials are now considering requiring isolation for anyone who spent five or ten minutes with a virus carrier.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases has gone up to almost 3,000 in Israel at the end of last week. While the health ministry has pushed for the suspension of commercial activities and remote learning for all grades above kindergarten in areas with high morbidity, the cabinet has yet to reach an agreement on any additional restrictions. The nationwide vaccination campaign began on December 20: prioritizing medical staff, at-risk populations and those over 60. By December 20, nearly 170,000 people had made vaccination appointments. The high volume of appointments almost crashed the ministryÕs call centers. The health ministry is reportedly aiming to vaccinate about 60% of the population by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Entry to Israel has now been barred for all foreign citizens arriving from the UK, Denmark and South Africa -- where new mutations of COVID-19 have been recorded. Israelis returning from these countries have been ordered to isolate in quarantine hotels.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases has stayed above 1,700 in Israel since the middle of last week. The country will reportedly roll out the COVID-19 vaccine as early as December 20, one week ahead of its previous target. The health ministry is planning to issue Ògreen passportsÓ to vaccinated residents, which will grant them benefits including a quarantine exemption, access to cultural events and restaurants, and advantages in international travel. Due to intra-Cabinet dissent and legal challenges, the governmentÕs plan to stop Israelis from visiting the homes of others and to impose a nationwide curfew during Hanukkah has been dropped. The government decided instead to impose new restrictions if the daily caseload exceeds 2,500. Shopping centers, museums and outdoor markets were allowed to open on December 9, subject to social distancing restrictions. Israel has further reduced its mandatory quarantine period from 12 to 10 days -- but travellers must receive two negative tests before leaving isolation.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Just weeks after the second nationwide lockdown, Israel is heading towards another resurgence. The number of daily new cases topped 1,500 at the end of last week. The government is reportedly looking at introducing a new quarantine-tracking system that will automatically check with those ordered to quarantine twice a day at random times. On November 30, further limits were put on shopping malls, which had previously reopened as part of a pilot program, after they were filled with customers. Instead of one person being allowed for every 7 square metres, only one person per 15 square metres will be permitted. A number of Israeli museums have been permitted to reopen as of December 1 as part of the same pilot program. Any visitors to the museums must order tickets online and admission will be limited. On December 6, many students in grades 7 to 10 began returning to their classrooms in communities with low-to-medium infection rates. The students will alternate between in-person and remote education.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases seems to be on the rise in Israel, nearing 1,000 at the end of last week. Israeli hospital administrators were reportedly in unanimous agreement that a third wave is approaching. The new Òcoronavirus czarÓ has announced a massive antibody testing program to grant a Ògreen passportÓ to those carrying antibodies. Following a lengthy debate on November 24, the Ôcoronavirus cabinetÕ approved the education ministerÕs plan to reopen most schools in areas with low-to-medium infection rates, with high schoolers going back to the classroom earlier than planned. Some high school students began returning to school on November 29, subject to reduced days of in-person education and other social distancing rules. Students in grades 1 and 2 returned to full-size classes to free up educational resources. Fifteen malls were permitted to reopen on November 27 under a pilot plan to evaluate the safety of further reopening. The reopening scheme is to be reassessed after a significant number of Israelis went to those malls.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While now out of its nationwide lockdown, Israel is still reporting around 800 new cases per day -- raising concerns about future spread. National leaders are once again looking to rapidly reopen the economy. The government approved the reopening of open-air shopping centers starting November 17 in low-infection areas. Grades 5 and 6 will return to in-person learning on November 24, with grades 11 and 12 following on December 1 in communities with low-to-medium infection rates. One indoor shopping mall will partially reopen as part of a pilot program. Localized lockdowns continue at major COVID-19 hotspots throughout the country. The national legislature approved the partial reopening of two Òspecial tourist islands,Ó including venues such as zoos, restaurants, large outdoor strip malls and other attractions. However, tourists will need a negative test result from the previous 72 hours to enter the Òislands.Ó The capacity limit on in-store customers was raised nationwide. Amid worries of a widespread unwillingness to get vaccinated, both the prime minister and the health ministry have denied pursuing a potential law to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in Israel has remained stable over the past week. After rounds of meetings of the so-called coronavirus cabinet, no further reopening or tightening of restrictions has been announced. The education ministry released its return-to-school proposal on November 11, subject to cabinet approval. The proposal suggests full-sized in-person classes for the first two grades, capsules of up to 20 students for grades 3 and 4, and alternate-mode learning (with limited days of in-person classes) for grades 5, 6, 11 and 12. A rapid COVID-19 testing center at IsraelÕs major international airport opened on November 9, allowing travelers to get onsite tests and diagnosis. Israel signed a deal with Pfizer on November 13 that could enable the vaccination of 4 million Israelis. After months of struggle with political leaders to push for his COVID-19 response strategy, the appointed Òcoronavirus czarÓ was replaced by a military officer on November 12. Without much power to achieve substantial progress, the outgoing official blamed the leaders for politicking.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel reported a dramatic decrease in its number of daily new cases, and the situation appears to be stabilizing. Cases have been increasing by around 700 a day over the past two weeks. The health ministry announced that an Israeli-developed system to expedite PCR-test processing would be rolled out in the coming weeks. Despite objections from top public health officials, the Israeli cabinet voted to allow street-front stores to reopen in areas with the lowest infection rates as of November 8 -- subject to capacity limits and other public health regulations.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of November 1, the number of active COVID-19 cases in Israel has fallen below 10,000. The health minister announced a pilot program to shorten the mandatory 14-day quarantine to 12 days, which would remain in place until the end of 2020. Another pilot program has been launched to analyze sewage Òfor signs of the coronavirusÓ in 14 cities and a university. Due to their high infection rates, two northern Israeli Arab towns face a week-long local lockdown until November 5. The reopening process continues elsewhere: houses of worship, beauty salons, and vacation rental homes were allowed to reopen on November 1. On the same date, students in grades 1-4 can return to the classroom in cohorts of up to 18 children, while street stores have to remain closed. The health ministryÕs lockdown exit plan has been shortened from nine to six stages. Due to the rising infection rate across Europe, Israel has added Italy, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, and others to the list of high-risk countries where travellers must quarantine upon their arrival in the country.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 21, the number of active COVID-19 cases fell below 20,000 for the first time since mid-July. The positivity rate of testing has also remained at a relatively low level. The military COVID-19 task force is working to enhance its capacity to perform 100,000 tests and 4,000 contact tracing probes per day in anticipation of outbreaks in the winter. Only one designated COVID-19 hotspot was unable to join the rest of the country in easing restrictions on October 20, with all others able to do so. The government is considering shortening the timeline for its lockdown exit strategy after it was previously expected to last for at least four months. Education and health officials have agreed to return students in grades 3 and 4 to in-person learning on November 1, while still debating the return of grades 1 and 2. The prime minister announced a proposal to increase fines for educational institutions operating in violation of lockdown restrictions in response to the reopening of schools in some ultra-Orthodox communities. The first human trials of an Israeli COVID-19 vaccine will begin on November 1 and are expected to continue through next spring.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has reported a dramatic improvement of almost all indicators of the epidemiological situation after a month of nationwide lockdown, showing the lowest daily new cases and positivity rate of testing in several months. Due to suspicion that COVID-19 patients are not revealing all of their close contacts, the national intelligence agency is reported to be involved in contact tracing. The government has approved the relaxation of some lockdown restrictions nationwide, except for in designated COVID-19 hotspots, and vowed to follow a gradual reopening process this time. Starting on October 18, people may move beyond 1km from home and visit others if they adhere to the gathering limit of 10 people indoors and 20 people outdoors. Restaurants can resume their takeout services, businesses which do not receive customers can reopen, and beaches and national parks can have visitors. Preschools and daycares are permitted to open even in designed hotspots, so lone as preschool teachers and aides get tested prior to returning to school. The ban on outgoing flights was lifted on October 16.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has reported a decreasing number of daily new cases and a lower positivity rate of testing. The health ministry has closed its hotline for reporting restriction violations and dismantled the team for overseeing quarantines due to labour constraints. According to the health ministryÕs plan for exiting the nationwide lockdown, the gradual reopening process is expected to last for at least four months, and it may begin as early as October 18 depending on the level of transmission. If the number of daily new cases drops to 2,000, the first stage of the plan would see preschools reopen, as well as businesses that do not receive customers. The restriction on moving beyond 1 kilometer from home will be lifted, restaurants will be able to offer to-go services, and protests may resume as before. The restrictions on protests and indoor religious services were extended to October 13 by the government, with another extension expected later this week.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Almost three weeks into the second nationwide lockdown, the positivity rate of testing has remained around 15%. Without any clear signs of substantial improvement, the prime minister has warned of even tighter restrictions. The health minister said that 1,500 additional beds, 20% of which are for critical patients on ventilators, would be provided to hospitals nationwide by mid-October. The police are moving to ramp up lockdown enforcement, especially in the ultra-Orthodox communities that have been criticized for violating restrictions. Amid heavy criticism, military forces sent to assist police in enforcing the lockdown will retreat from their mission. Border police will take their place. The restriction on outgoing flights has not been enforced at the countryÕs largest airport due to legal difficulties, and the government is working on a solution. On September 30, the legislature approved the governmentÕs controversial plan to curtail public protests, and removed the exemption enjoyed by protesters and religious services from general gathering limits. Protesters can no longer travel beyond 1 kilometer from their home. The protests against the prime minister were then converted into hundreds of smaller and localized gatherings across the country in adherence to the new restrictions.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A sharp increase in infection numbers, with test positivity tests rates above 10%, has prompted the Israeli government to take radical action. On September 23, the health ministry ordered an immediate recruitment of paramedics to provide backup to hospitals. As hospitals get overwhelmed by the surge in patients, some are utilizing their underground facilities to accommodate extra people.The defense minister has ordered that the Israel Defence Forces begin preparations for establishing a COVID-19 field hospital, and a lockdown exit strategy. The military would also have an increased participation in contact tracing. Only one week into the more ÒflexibleÓ version of nationwide lockdown, the government has decided to push for a full lockdown that is stricter than it was in the spring. The entire economy will be closed except for some designated essential businesses and industries. Restaurants will only be permitted to offer delivery. Gatherings are limited to 10 people indoors and 20 outdoors, though the government has asked people to avoid gatherings altogether. Protests also have to comply with the 1-kilometer limit from peopleÕs homes. The main airport will close to outgoing flights. All proposed changes went into effect on September 25, except for restrictions on protesters and religious services, because they went beyond the cabinetÕs authority. The legislature is still debating the restrictions and has not yet given its final approval.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel experienced a dramatic increase in new cases last week, prompting the government to give final approval to an indefinite nationwide lockdown. Nearly 7,000 police officers and soldiers were deployed throughout the country amid concerns over public defiance of the lockdown. While the public has largely adhered to the pandemic-related restrictions, there have been a number of reports of recent violations. Hospitals have been ordered to open new COVID-19 wards. The healthcare system is approaching its capacity for patients in serious condition. Massive protests, which are exempt from the lockdown, have continued. However, police announced that protesters would be divided into groups of 20 and would be required to follow social distancing regulations within and between groups. The lockdown began on September 18. People are not allowed to move beyond 500 meters from their home, which was expanded to 1 km on the first day of the lockdown. Exceptions are granted for attending to essential activities, such as going to work or accessing healthcare. Visiting the homes of other people is banned. Gatherings are capped at 10 people indoors and 20 people outdoors. Malls, swimming pools, gyms, hairdressers, hotels, and other leisure services are closed. Supermarkets, pharmacies, hardware stores, electronic stores, laundromats and additional stores deemed essential will remain open. No more than three people can travel in the same car except for members of the same family. Only a limited number of passengers are allowed on public transportation. Workplaces in the private sector are not permitted to hold meetings with more than 10 people present; in-person services are prohibited. However, there are a number of exceptions to the current lockdown that were not present during the spring lockdown. Schools were closed one day earlier on September 17.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The level of daily new infections has continued to climb up in Israel. The public health system is seriously overwhelmed by the growing number of COVID-19 patients, especially those in critical condition. The Health Ministry has reportedly sought an immediate nationwide full lockdown lasting for at least a month, but some small businesses and self-employed workers have said they will go against any lockdown order that is implemented. After multiple delays, a “traffic light” plan that differentiates between municipalities based on their local infection rates was approved by the government and went into effect on September 6. “Red” municipalities face the strictest restrictions – outdoor gatherings capped at 20 people and gatherings indoors at 10.  “Green” municipalities can have gatherings of 250 people outdoors and 100 indoors. However, different restrictions on schools were rejected by the Ministers in order to keep schools open everywhere. Despite backlash from ultra-Orthodox leaders, a curfew from 7 pm to 5 am will be in effect in 40 towns and neighbourhoods throughout the country. The curfew started on September 8 and will be in place for at least one week. The curfew closes schools and most businesses. Amid reports of widespread public violations of social distancing, mask-wearing and other health guidelines on the first night of the curfew, the acting police chief has ordered enhanced enforcement of the restrictions. A controversial phone tracking scheme by the national security agency was extended for 10 days on September 6, less than the 21 days requested by the government. An 8-day strike by technicians at publicly funded testing labs ended on September 6 after an agreement was reached with the government. At present, non-Israeli passport holders who do not come from countries with low infection rates are banned from entering the country until at least October 1.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has seen a persistently high level of daily new cases over the past several weeks. The Health Ministry admitted to undercounting some COVID-19 deaths at senior living homes. The Ministry of Health's Director General has created a uniform system for reporting deaths at all medical facilities. A cabinet vote on the “traffic light” plan, which implements restrictions based on local morbidity rates, has been postponed for a third time to August 24--reportedly due to opposition to shutting some synagogues. In trials involving hundreds of patients, the Israeli gargle-and-spit test yielded COVID results in one second with 95% accuracy. Meanwhile, an Israeli COVID-19 breath test using nanotechnology has correctly identified all positive patients in a clinical trial involving 140 people in Wuhan, China. Border officials now suspect that some travellers presented forged papers showing negative COVID tests. The Corona Cabinet has approved an amendment to the restrictions on gatherings starting August 17. Restaurants, public places, businesses and houses of worship are now capped at 20 people in a closed space regardless of size.  The limit is 30 people in an open space. The top COVID-19 health official said that he backed the full reopening of almost all schools, even as infections showed few signs of slowing down.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new daily infections in Israel has continued to hover around 1,700 for most of the past two weeks. Reportedly overwhelmed hospitals are now considered “under capacity” after officials rectified the capacity calculation. Meanwhile, the National Security Council has warned that Israel could face a shortage of the protective equipment needed by medical staff as soon as next month. The clinical trial of a drug made from antibodies began in Jerusalem, with three patients in moderate condition released from hospital days after receiving the drug. Using recordings collected in India, Israeli engineers are working on a system that uses voice detection to screen for potential virus carriers. The Health Minister said that Israel is interested in holding discussions with Russia about its claims of a working, ready-for-use vaccine. Workers at national laboratories have threatened to go on strike as of August 30 amid a breakdown in talks over pay and working conditions. The coronavirus cabinet has approved additional restrictions on indoor spaces while easing other limits against crowding in open-air spaces that came into effect on August 16. Closed spaces such as businesses and restaurants that are smaller than 80 square meters can have no more than 10 people.  Up to 20 people are allowed in larger settings. In open spaces, crowds of up to 30 people will be permitted—an increase from the previous 20-person limit. A plan for outdoor performances has been approved. Performances will now take the form of "capsules" containing up to 20 people and the performances with an audience of no more than 500 people will get immediate approval. A color-coded system has been developed in which cities and towns will see restrictions adapted to their local situations. In “red” cities, the highest level, schools may not open in the fall. Starting August 16, Israelis returning from 17 countries designated as “green” are now allowed to enter Israel without needing to quarantine. Israeli tourists will be able to enter Greece, Croatia and Bulgaria without compulsory quarantine, but with some other restrictions.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New daily cases in Israel have hovered around 1,700 in recent days. COVID-19 wards in hospitals have been overwhelmed far beyond their capacity. In a policy reversal, the Health Ministry reportedly said that anyone exposed to virus carriers can be tested--even if they are not displaying symptoms. The government will begin implementing a color-coded system by September 1 under which cities and towns have their policies adapted to the local situation. On August 6, the government approved an end to the weekend closure of shopping centers, stores, markets and public playgrounds. Cultural events will be opened immediately in 'capsules' of 20 people in open spaces. However, the government has also approved a series of restrictions that would take effect on August 11.  This includes extending the cap on public gatherings (currently, 20 people outdoors and 10 indoors), and keeping bars, nightclubs, water parks, event halls and other entertainment venues closed. Shared eating spaces in open-air markets and in shopping malls will also be closed. Deliveries must be left outside recipients’ doors. Businesses will be prohibited from serving customers not wearing a mask and temperature checks must be conducted before entry. The Education Minister has promised to open schools on September 1. A $1.2 billion school plan has been approved, with a significant portion dedicated to improving remote learning infrastructure. A plan for reopening air travel is being developed to allow flights again on August 16.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel continues to have a fairly high level of daily new infections, sometimes exceeding 2,000 per day. The number of tests conducted dropped significantly over the past weekend, but the positivity rate has been steady. The director-general of the Health Ministry hoped that the military would take over the overwhelmed contact tracing program by this week. HaMagen 2, the second version of the contact tracing app, was launched on July 27. It combines GPS data recording with Bluetooth proximity detection. The newly appointed coordinator for the COVID-19 response revealed the outline of his plan on July 28.  The plan, which aims to rebuild public trust, emphasized the socioeconomic situation and was skeptical of sweeping lockdown measures. A more detailed plan is expected on August 5. Following the success of restaurant owners in delaying their government-ordered closure, a union representing event hall owners threatened to reopen their businesses this week. A number of retailers also kept their doors open over the past weekend in defiance of the weekend shutdown regulations. The government is now extremely hesitant about changing the COVID-19 restrictions. The cabinet approved a $1.2 billion plan on August 2 for the coming school year, which is scheduled to begin on September 1. Under the plan, kindergartens and grades 1-2 will operate with normal group sizes. Students in grades 3-4 will learn in “capsules” capped at 18 students. Grades 5-12 will have online education for most of the week. The Health Ministry said that it was working on a plan to allow incoming flights without medical checks or quarantine requirements from countries with low morbidity. The plan is expected to come into effect on August 16.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 21, there are now more than 30,000 active cases in Israel. There has also been a steady decline in the amount of tests processed over the past few days. The government and the parliamentary panel in charge of COVID-19 restrictions have continued to experience significant tension. A controversial law has been passed that grants the government expanded powers to impose wide-ranging restrictions while reducing parliamentary oversight -- a move seen as designed to weaken oversight by the Knesset. A number of lawmakers from the Prime Minister’s party are planning to join opposition politicians on a committee to challenge the government’s handling of the pandemic. Starting on July 22, all COVID-19 patients may leave isolation after 10 days if they had 3 consecutive days with no symptoms. The Finance Ministry promised to add 2,000 temporary nursing and 400 doctor positions to the public healthcare system after reaching an agreement with the country’s nurses. They will also hire additional security personnel at sensitive locations. Mass demonstrations continued against the Prime Minister and his government’s handling of the pandemic. After a tumultuous week that saw some planned closures overturned by the parliamentary panel, the approved new restrictions came into effect on July 24. Most stores, markets, shopping centres, personal care services, and gyms must close on weekends. Restaurants are allowed to continue their operations under the existing rules, which allow up to 20 diners indoors and 30 outdoors. Beaches and swimming pools will also remain open. Gatherings are currently permitted for up to 10 people indoors and 20 people outdoors. On July 23, the government announced that new international students would be allowed to enter the country for the next academic year. A new plan on managing incoming air travellers has been proposed. Travellers from low-risk countries will only have to spend 5 days in quarantine, while those from high-risk countries will have to undergo a test prior to their arrival in Israel.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Daily new infections in Israel are now approaching 2,000. The Health Ministry is planning to allow 8 to 10 samples to be examined at once and conduct individual tests if the batch is positive. This is to cut down on testing time and to allow for more samples to be tested. On July 14, the Israeli Health Ministry admitted under pressure that more than 12,000 citizens had been mistakenly sent into quarantine after being flagged by the country’s phone tracking system. Nurses are set to go on strike on July 20 over heavy workload and labour shortages. Israel is under immediate risk of reaching its healthcare capacity, with some saying they could do so in as little as three weeks. Mass protests have broken out against the Prime Minister and the government’s economic policy during the pandemic. Reports have also suggested that there is considerable tension among top officials in the government over the handling of the pandemic. A series of new restrictions came into effect on July 17. Gyms and studios are closed again after the legislature overturned the government’s decision to reopen outdoor public pools and gyms on July 13. Eateries are only allowed to offer takeaway services, but the implementation of this restriction was postponed to July 21 due to widespread threats to defy government orders. Indoor gatherings may not have more than 10 people, but there can be up to 20 people outdoors. All stores, shopping malls, open-air markets, hair salons, libraries, petting zoos, museums, pools, tourist attractions, and cable cars will be forced to close on weekends.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel is experiencing an extremely high rate of transmission. The country reported a record-high 1,684 new infections on July 10, with new cases tripling from two weeks ago. The number of active cases has gone up by 500% since June 7. A number of government officials have also been in self-isolation after exposure to infected persons. The Health Ministry has told hospitals to prepare for a coming influx of patients. Facing criticism over the government’s handling of the pandemic, the Prime Minister acknowledged that some reopening measures were premature. More neighbourhoods are being put under seven-day lockdowns, including parts of Jerusalem. Citizens have been warned about a possible second nationwide lockdown if daily new cases exceed 2,000. The Health Ministry is reportedly planning to tighten the testing criteria to relieve the burden on the overwhelmed testing system. Asymptomatic people will no longer be able to get tested, and the ability of family physicians to provide referrals for tests has been reduced. A controversial law was passed on July 7, allowing the government to impose restrictions immediately and seek parliament approval afterwards. The reopening process is being reversed. Gatherings with more than 20 individuals are prohibited in all cases. Restaurants have been forced to limit their indoor and outdoor capacity. Cultural institutions, event halls, clubs, bars, gyms and public swimming pools are now closed. Summer schools, camps and youth activities are not allowed for students higher than fourth grade. Buses are limited to a maximum of 20 people each.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new infections reached 1,130 on July 3, having doubled from a week prior. More neighborhoods have been designated as “restricted areas” and placed under partial lockdown. The prime minister urged public health officials to reduce the time needed for an epidemiological investigation to 48 hours and to shorten the period of test delivery to 12 hours. The system for epidemiological investigation is reported to be overwhelmed by the surge of infections. On July 1, the Israeli parliament approved a proposal to have the national intelligence agency track the cellphones of virus carriers for the next three weeks. The new law allows the agency to access an individual’s phone location data for the 14 days prior to their diagnosis. The government decided to tighten some restrictions on June 29. Outdoor gatherings of more than 50 individuals and indoor gatherings of more than 20 are now prohibited, with the exception of cultural events capped at 250. All businesses and services continue to operate when complying with physical distancing and hygiene rules. People are asked to refrain from visiting their relatives in high-risk groups. University and college exams will be held remotely, and at least 30 percent of employees in the public sector must work from home.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel’s new infections have been skyrocketing and reached 532 new cases per day on June 24. The total active case count has exceeded 5,000, doubling that number two weeks before. Officials predict a sharp rise in the coming few days with as many as 1,000 new daily cases. The Corona Cabinet decided upon a series of immediate measures on June 22, including: establishing a centralized enforcement authority, increasing fines, continuing protection at centers for the elderly, evaluating return to work in self-contained shifts and approving school activities during the summer vacation. The Israel Defense Force was ordered to open additional quarantine hotels for patients who cannot adequately self-isolate at home. The Health Ministry has allocated a budget to integrate 300 auxiliary workers to assist with epidemiological investigation and has instructed hospitals around the country to prepare to reopen their COVID-19 wards. The bill resuming the national spy agency’s involvement in contact tracing, unanimously backed by the Cabinet, will move ahead to the national legislature despite opposition by the head of the agency. While reopening has been mostly frozen, cultural events accommodating up to 250 people were permitted starting June 21. Intercity rail services restarted on June 22 with a cap of 500 passengers on each train while only about 30% of the approved capacity was utilized. Strict travel restrictions apply and travelers must also book their places online. Multiple neighborhoods have been designated as restricted areas and put under partial lockdown for a week long duration. Within these neighborhoods, gatherings of more than 50 people will be prohibited. Schools will also be shut in some neighborhoods. The government’s attempt to force teachers to work into July to recoup missed classes was denied by the court on June 18. School children will have their vacation start by the end of June.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has witnessed an uptick in new cases over recent weeks, occasionally exceeding 200 confirmed cases per day. Many of the increases are concentrated in schools, sending thousands of students and teachers home for quarantine. Big cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem continue to be transmission hotspots. The Israeli health ministry has been permitted to accept Gilead Sciences’ donation of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. While all other reopening plans have been frozen, the cap on the number of people attending weddings and some religious rites was raised to 250 people on June 14. A phone number list of all participants must be kept for 20 days. Other events can only accommodate a maximum of 50 people, as previously established. Schools continue to be open to all students. The government is considering re-imposing some restrictive measures, about which few details have been provided.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After a sustained drop in the daily infection rate, Israel has seen a surge of infections by more than 800 new cases in the past week, especially in schools. Increased enforcement has been ordered to stop large gatherings and mandate mask-wearing. On June 9, the Israeli Health Minister set the daily test target at 30,000. At the same time, serological tests have been formally launched this week, aiming at testing 70,000 citizens. There has also been rising concern about simultaneous waves of COVID-19 and influenza infections this winter, due to a global race for flu vaccines. The involvement of a national spy agency in contact tracing and monitoring has been halted without another bill legislating how it would continue to operate after three months. Seeing a spike in new cases, the government has decided to freeze plans for further reopening, while the number of participants allowed at events was raised to 250 people. Concert venues will resume later. The scheduled return of train services on June 8 is postponed. People are urged to stick to three basic principles: physical distancing, wearing masks and hygiene. The government has decided that the resumption of in-person schooling will not be affected even with recent outbreaks. While many university studies are online, some foreign university students have been returning, dependent upon following the mandatory two-week quarantine on campus. Borders remain closed to foreign travellers.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has seen an uptick in case over the past week, with daily increases occasionally exceeding 100. A cluster of outbreaks at schools have aroused nationwide concerns, sending thousands of students and teachers home. After a month of delays, the widespread antibody testing started last week to help determine the population’s exposure to the virus. A pilot program was launched in regions with high infection rates. Some 70,000 people are set to be tested initially. Early results indicated that the infection rate might be greater than previously thought, with a greater chance of carriers with no symptoms.  As of May 30, drive-in compounds have been used at multiple locations to conduct testing on designated people. To help reach their target of 100,000 tests per day, various companies are working on new testing kits that produce results within a minute. As reopening progresses, some of the last remaining businesses that were closed are now permitted to resume, this includes restaurants, hotels, pools and other establishments. Temperature checks are required before entering restaurants. Places like cinemas are set to open in mid-June. Men’s professional soccer resumed on May 30 without spectators. All schools resumed full activities as of May 31. An order was signed to allow higher education systems to have increased activities like in-person lessons and examinations. Universities and colleges are displeased with the lack of preparation time.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has maintained a low level of new COVID-19 infections - fewer than 30 per day - and very few new deaths. A ministerial committee has been established as the supreme coordinating body to handle the pandemic and formulate plans for a possible second wave. The Israeli cabinet decided to limit the involvement of spy agencies in contact tracing only to infected people on May 24, stating the priority of epidemiological investigation. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, swimming pools, hotels and tourist attractions can resume operations, conditional on the observance of physical distancing, hygiene rules, and wearing masks. Seating in food courts in malls is still restricted. The physical distancing requirement in museums has been halved to 1 visitor per 7 square meters. Up to 50 people can be present in gatherings in open areas. Bus operation at 75% capacity was permitted this week, and trains will resume full activities from June 8. 2 passengers are allowed to join the driver in a private vehicle. There are now no specific restrictions on the number of workers at the workplace as long as infection prevention rules are followed, and a maximum of 50 people can be present at professional meetings. The entry ban for university and religious academic program students who do not hold Israeli passports has been relaxed to facilitate studies completion, and the educational institutions involved have to support students’ self-isolation.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a steady decline in new cases over the past two weeks, Israel has continued to amend emergency regulations to enable further reopening. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, clubs, swimming pools, and hotels will be opened. Extracurricular activities will also be allowed. Museums are being permitted to open without interactive activities involving direct contact. Events in open areas are allowed to be held, and up to 50 people can attend mass gatherings. Students are currently alternating between in-person and remote teaching. A school will be closed if any confirmed case is discovered. Physical distancing, wearing masks, and practising hygiene remain the key principles for relaxation.</p>
