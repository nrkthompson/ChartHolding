  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 21, the number of active COVID-19 cases fell below 20,000 for the first time since mid-July. The positivity rate of testing has also remained at a relatively low level. The military COVID-19 task force is working to enhance its capacity to perform 100,000 tests and 4,000 contact tracing probes per day in anticipation of outbreaks in the winter. Only one designated COVID-19 hotspot was unable to join the rest of the country in easing restrictions on October 20, with all others able to do so. The government is considering shortening the timeline for its lockdown exit strategy after it was previously expected to last for at least four months. Education and health officials have agreed to return students in grades 3 and 4 to in-person learning on November 1, while still debating the return of grades 1 and 2. The prime minister announced a proposal to increase fines for educational institutions operating in violation of lockdown restrictions in response to the reopening of schools in some ultra-Orthodox communities. The first human trials of an Israeli COVID-19 vaccine will begin on November 1 and are expected to continue through next spring.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has reported a dramatic improvement of almost all indicators of the epidemiological situation after a month of nationwide lockdown, showing the lowest daily new cases and positivity rate of testing in several months. Due to suspicion that COVID-19 patients are not revealing all of their close contacts, the national intelligence agency is reported to be involved in contact tracing. The government has approved the relaxation of some lockdown restrictions nationwide, except for in designated COVID-19 hotspots, and vowed to follow a gradual reopening process this time. Starting on October 18, people may move beyond 1km from home and visit others if they adhere to the gathering limit of 10 people indoors and 20 people outdoors. Restaurants can resume their takeout services, businesses which do not receive customers can reopen, and beaches and national parks can have visitors. Preschools and daycares are permitted to open even in designed hotspots, so lone as preschool teachers and aides get tested prior to returning to school. The ban on outgoing flights was lifted on October 16.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has reported a decreasing number of daily new cases and a lower positivity rate of testing. The health ministry has closed its hotline for reporting restriction violations and dismantled the team for overseeing quarantines due to labour constraints. According to the health ministry’s plan for exiting the nationwide lockdown, the gradual reopening process is expected to last for at least four months, and it may begin as early as October 18 depending on the level of transmission. If the number of daily new cases drops to 2,000, the first stage of the plan would see preschools reopen, as well as businesses that do not receive customers. The restriction on moving beyond 1 kilometer from home will be lifted, restaurants will be able to offer to-go services, and protests may resume as before. The restrictions on protests and indoor religious services were extended to October 13 by the government, with another extension expected later this week.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Almost three weeks into the second nationwide lockdown, the positivity rate of testing has remained around 15%. Without any clear signs of substantial improvement, the prime minister has warned of even tighter restrictions. The health minister said that 1,500 additional beds, 20% of which are for critical patients on ventilators, would be provided to hospitals nationwide by mid-October. The police are moving to ramp up lockdown enforcement, especially in the ultra-Orthodox communities that have been criticized for violating restrictions. Amid heavy criticism, military forces sent to assist police in enforcing the lockdown will retreat from their mission. Border police will take their place. The restriction on outgoing flights has not been enforced at the country’s largest airport due to legal difficulties, and the government is working on a solution. On September 30, the legislature approved the government’s controversial plan to curtail public protests, and removed the exemption enjoyed by protesters and religious services from general gathering limits. Protesters can no longer travel beyond 1 kilometer from their home. The protests against the prime minister were then converted into hundreds of smaller and localized gatherings across the country in adherence to the new restrictions.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A sharp increase in infection numbers, with test positivity tests rates above 10%, has prompted the Israeli government to take radical action. On September 23, the health ministry ordered an immediate recruitment of paramedics to provide backup to hospitals. As hospitals get overwhelmed by the surge in patients, some are utilizing their underground facilities to accommodate extra people.The defense minister has ordered that the Israel Defence Forces begin preparations for establishing a COVID-19 field hospital, and a lockdown exit strategy. The military would also have an increased participation in contact tracing. Only one week into the more “flexible” version of nationwide lockdown, the government has decided to push for a full lockdown that is stricter than it was in the spring. The entire economy will be closed except for some designated essential businesses and industries. Restaurants will only be permitted to offer delivery. Gatherings are limited to 10 people indoors and 20 outdoors, though the government has asked people to avoid gatherings altogether. Protests also have to comply with the 1-kilometer limit from people’s homes. The main airport will close to outgoing flights. All proposed changes went into effect on September 25, except for restrictions on protesters and religious services, because they went beyond the cabinet’s authority. The legislature is still debating the restrictions and has not yet given its final approval.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel experienced a dramatic increase in new cases last week, prompting the government to give final approval to an indefinite nationwide lockdown. Nearly 7,000 police officers and soldiers were deployed throughout the country amid concerns over public defiance of the lockdown. While the public has largely adhered to the pandemic-related restrictions, there have been a number of reports of recent violations. Hospitals have been ordered to open new COVID-19 wards. The healthcare system is approaching its capacity for patients in serious condition. Massive protests, which are exempt from the lockdown, have continued. However, police announced that protesters would be divided into groups of 20 and would be required to follow social distancing regulations within and between groups. The lockdown began on September 18. People are not allowed to move beyond 500 meters from their home, which was expanded to 1 km on the first day of the lockdown. Exceptions are granted for attending to essential activities, such as going to work or accessing healthcare. Visiting the homes of other people is banned. Gatherings are capped at 10 people indoors and 20 people outdoors. Malls, swimming pools, gyms, hairdressers, hotels, and other leisure services are closed. Supermarkets, pharmacies, hardware stores, electronic stores, laundromats and additional stores deemed essential will remain open. No more than three people can travel in the same car except for members of the same family. Only a limited number of passengers are allowed on public transportation. Workplaces in the private sector are not permitted to hold meetings with more than 10 people present; in-person services are prohibited. However, there are a number of exceptions to the current lockdown that were not present during the spring lockdown. Schools were closed one day earlier on September 17.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The level of daily new infections has continued to climb up in Israel. The public health system is seriously overwhelmed by the growing number of COVID-19 patients, especially those in critical condition. The Health Ministry has reportedly sought an immediate nationwide full lockdown lasting for at least a month, but some small businesses and self-employed workers have said they will go against any lockdown order that is implemented. After multiple delays, a ìtraffic lightî plan that differentiates between municipalities based on their local infection rates was approved by the government and went into effect on September 6. ìRedî municipalities face the strictest restrictions ñ outdoor gatherings capped at 20 people and gatherings indoors at 10.  ìGreenî municipalities can have gatherings of 250 people outdoors and 100 indoors. However, different restrictions on schools were rejected by the Ministers in order to keep schools open everywhere. Despite backlash from ultra-Orthodox leaders, a curfew from 7 pm to 5 am will be in effect in 40 towns and neighbourhoods throughout the country. The curfew started on September 8 and will be in place for at least one week. The curfew closes schools and most businesses. Amid reports of widespread public violations of social distancing, mask-wearing and other health guidelines on the first night of the curfew, the acting police chief has ordered enhanced enforcement of the restrictions. A controversial phone tracking scheme by the national security agency was extended for 10 days on September 6, less than the 21 days requested by the government. An 8-day strike by technicians at publicly funded testing labs ended on September 6 after an agreement was reached with the government. At present, non-Israeli passport holders who do not come from countries with low infection rates are banned from entering the country until at least October 1.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has seen a persistently high level of daily new cases over the past several weeks. The Health Ministry admitted to undercounting some COVID-19 deaths at senior living homes. The Ministry of Health's Director General has created a uniform system for reporting deaths at all medical facilities. A cabinet vote on the ìtraffic lightî plan, which implements restrictions based on local morbidity rates, has been postponed for a third time to August 24--reportedly due to opposition to shutting some synagogues. In trials involving hundreds of patients, the Israeli gargle-and-spit test yielded COVID results in one second with 95% accuracy. Meanwhile, an Israeli COVID-19 breath test using nanotechnology has correctly identified all positive patients in a clinical trial involving 140 people in Wuhan, China. Border officials now suspect that some travellers presented forged papers showing negative COVID tests. The Corona Cabinet has approved an amendment to the restrictions on gatherings starting August 17. Restaurants, public places, businesses and houses of worship are now capped at 20 people in a closed space regardless of size.  The limit is 30 people in an open space. The top COVID-19 health official said that he backed the full reopening of almost all schools, even as infections showed few signs of slowing down.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new daily infections in Israel has continued to hover around 1,700 for most of the past two weeks. Reportedly overwhelmed hospitals are now considered ìunder capacityî after officials rectified the capacity calculation. Meanwhile, the National Security Council has warned that Israel could face a shortage of the protective equipment needed by medical staff as soon as next month. The clinical trial of a drug made from antibodies began in Jerusalem, with three patients in moderate condition released from hospital days after receiving the drug. Using recordings collected in India, Israeli engineers are working on a system that uses voice detection to screen for potential virus carriers. The Health Minister said that Israel is interested in holding discussions with Russia about its claims of a working, ready-for-use vaccine. Workers at national laboratories have threatened to go on strike as of August 30 amid a breakdown in talks over pay and working conditions. The coronavirus cabinet has approved additional restrictions on indoor spaces while easing other limits against crowding in open-air spaces that came into effect on August 16. Closed spaces such as businesses and restaurants that are smaller than 80 square meters can have no more than 10 people.  Up to 20 people are allowed in larger settings. In open spaces, crowds of up to 30 people will be permittedóan increase from the previous 20-person limit. A plan for outdoor performances has been approved. Performances will now take the form of "capsules" containing up to 20 people and the performances with an audience of no more than 500 people will get immediate approval. A color-coded system has been developed in which cities and towns will see restrictions adapted to their local situations. In ìredî cities, the highest level, schools may not open in the fall. Starting August 16, Israelis returning from 17 countries designated as ìgreenî are now allowed to enter Israel without needing to quarantine. Israeli tourists will be able to enter Greece, Croatia and Bulgaria without compulsory quarantine, but with some other restrictions.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New daily cases in Israel have hovered around 1,700 in recent days. COVID-19 wards in hospitals have been overwhelmed far beyond their capacity. In a policy reversal, the Health Ministry reportedly said that anyone exposed to virus carriers can be tested--even if they are not displaying symptoms. The government will begin implementing a color-coded system by September 1 under which cities and towns have their policies adapted to the local situation. On August 6, the government approved an end to the weekend closure of shopping centers, stores, markets and public playgrounds. Cultural events will be opened immediately in 'capsules' of 20 people in open spaces. However, the government has also approved a series of restrictions that would take effect on August 11.  This includes extending the cap on public gatherings (currently, 20 people outdoors and 10 indoors), and keeping bars, nightclubs, water parks, event halls and other entertainment venues closed. Shared eating spaces in open-air markets and in shopping malls will also be closed. Deliveries must be left outside recipientsí doors. Businesses will be prohibited from serving customers not wearing a mask and temperature checks must be conducted before entry. The Education Minister has promised to open schools on September 1. A $1.2 billion school plan has been approved, with a significant portion dedicated to improving remote learning infrastructure. A plan for reopening air travel is being developed to allow flights again on August 16.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel continues to have a fairly high level of daily new infections, sometimes exceeding 2,000 per day. The number of tests conducted dropped significantly over the past weekend, but the positivity rate has been steady. The director-general of the Health Ministry hoped that the military would take over the overwhelmed contact tracing program by this week. HaMagen 2, the second version of the contact tracing app, was launched on July 27. It combines GPS data recording with Bluetooth proximity detection. The newly appointed coordinator for the COVID-19 response revealed the outline of his plan on July 28.  The plan, which aims to rebuild public trust, emphasized the socioeconomic situation and was skeptical of sweeping lockdown measures. A more detailed plan is expected on August 5. Following the success of restaurant owners in delaying their government-ordered closure, a union representing event hall owners threatened to reopen their businesses this week. A number of retailers also kept their doors open over the past weekend in defiance of the weekend shutdown regulations. The government is now extremely hesitant about changing the COVID-19 restrictions. The cabinet approved a $1.2 billion plan on August 2 for the coming school year, which is scheduled to begin on September 1. Under the plan, kindergartens and grades 1-2 will operate with normal group sizes. Students in grades 3-4 will learn in ìcapsulesî capped at 18 students. Grades 5-12 will have online education for most of the week. The Health Ministry said that it was working on a plan to allow incoming flights without medical checks or quarantine requirements from countries with low morbidity. The plan is expected to come into effect on August 16.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 21, there are now more than 30,000 active cases in Israel. There has also been a steady decline in the amount of tests processed over the past few days. The government and the parliamentary panel in charge of COVID-19 restrictions have continued to experience significant tension. A controversial law has been passed that grants the government expanded powers to impose wide-ranging restrictions while reducing parliamentary oversight -- a move seen as designed to weaken oversight by the Knesset. A number of lawmakers from the Prime Ministerís party are planning to join opposition politicians on a committee to challenge the governmentís handling of the pandemic. Starting on July 22, all COVID-19 patients may leave isolation after 10 days if they had 3 consecutive days with no symptoms. The Finance Ministry promised to add 2,000 temporary nursing and 400 doctor positions to the public healthcare system after reaching an agreement with the countryís nurses. They will also hire additional security personnel at sensitive locations. Mass demonstrations continued against the Prime Minister and his governmentís handling of the pandemic. After a tumultuous week that saw some planned closures overturned by the parliamentary panel, the approved new restrictions came into effect on July 24. Most stores, markets, shopping centres, personal care services, and gyms must close on weekends. Restaurants are allowed to continue their operations under the existing rules, which allow up to 20 diners indoors and 30 outdoors. Beaches and swimming pools will also remain open. Gatherings are currently permitted for up to 10 people indoors and 20 people outdoors. On July 23, the government announced that new international students would be allowed to enter the country for the next academic year. A new plan on managing incoming air travellers has been proposed. Travellers from low-risk countries will only have to spend 5 days in quarantine, while those from high-risk countries will have to undergo a test prior to their arrival in Israel.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Daily new infections in Israel are now approaching 2,000. The Health Ministry is planning to allow 8 to 10 samples to be examined at once and conduct individual tests if the batch is positive. This is to cut down on testing time and to allow for more samples to be tested. On July 14, the Israeli Health Ministry admitted under pressure that more than 12,000 citizens had been mistakenly sent into quarantine after being flagged by the countryís phone tracking system. Nurses are set to go on strike on July 20 over heavy workload and labour shortages. Israel is under immediate risk of reaching its healthcare capacity, with some saying they could do so in as little as three weeks. Mass protests have broken out against the Prime Minister and the governmentís economic policy during the pandemic. Reports have also suggested that there is considerable tension among top officials in the government over the handling of the pandemic. A series of new restrictions came into effect on July 17. Gyms and studios are closed again after the legislature overturned the governmentís decision to reopen outdoor public pools and gyms on July 13. Eateries are only allowed to offer takeaway services, but the implementation of this restriction was postponed to July 21 due to widespread threats to defy government orders. Indoor gatherings may not have more than 10 people, but there can be up to 20 people outdoors. All stores, shopping malls, open-air markets, hair salons, libraries, petting zoos, museums, pools, tourist attractions, and cable cars will be forced to close on weekends.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel is experiencing an extremely high rate of transmission. The country reported a record-high 1,684 new infections on July 10, with new cases tripling from two weeks ago. The number of active cases has gone up by 500% since June 7. A number of government officials have also been in self-isolation after exposure to infected persons. The Health Ministry has told hospitals to prepare for a coming influx of patients. Facing criticism over the governmentís handling of the pandemic, the Prime Minister acknowledged that some reopening measures were premature. More neighbourhoods are being put under seven-day lockdowns, including parts of Jerusalem. Citizens have been warned about a possible second nationwide lockdown if daily new cases exceed 2,000. The Health Ministry is reportedly planning to tighten the testing criteria to relieve the burden on the overwhelmed testing system. Asymptomatic people will no longer be able to get tested, and the ability of family physicians to provide referrals for tests has been reduced. A controversial law was passed on July 7, allowing the government to impose restrictions immediately and seek parliament approval afterwards. The reopening process is being reversed. Gatherings with more than 20 individuals are prohibited in all cases. Restaurants have been forced to limit their indoor and outdoor capacity. Cultural institutions, event halls, clubs, bars, gyms and public swimming pools are now closed. Summer schools, camps and youth activities are not allowed for students higher than fourth grade. Buses are limited to a maximum of 20 people each.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new infections reached 1,130 on July 3, having doubled from a week prior. More neighborhoods have been designated as ìrestricted areasî and placed under partial lockdown. The prime minister urged public health officials to reduce the time needed for an epidemiological investigation to 48 hours and to shorten the period of test delivery to 12 hours. The system for epidemiological investigation is reported to be overwhelmed by the surge of infections. On July 1, the Israeli parliament approved a proposal to have the national intelligence agency track the cellphones of virus carriers for the next three weeks. The new law allows the agency to access an individualís phone location data for the 14 days prior to their diagnosis. The government decided to tighten some restrictions on June 29. Outdoor gatherings of more than 50 individuals and indoor gatherings of more than 20 are now prohibited, with the exception of cultural events capped at 250. All businesses and services continue to operate when complying with physical distancing and hygiene rules. People are asked to refrain from visiting their relatives in high-risk groups. University and college exams will be held remotely, and at least 30 percent of employees in the public sector must work from home.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israelís new infections have been skyrocketing and reached 532 new cases per day on June 24. The total active case count has exceeded 5,000, doubling that number two weeks before. Officials predict a sharp rise in the coming few days with as many as 1,000 new daily cases. The Corona Cabinet decided upon a series of immediate measures on June 22, including: establishing a centralized enforcement authority, increasing fines, continuing protection at centers for the elderly, evaluating return to work in self-contained shifts and approving school activities during the summer vacation. The Israel Defense Force was ordered to open additional quarantine hotels for patients who cannot adequately self-isolate at home. The Health Ministry has allocated a budget to integrate 300 auxiliary workers to assist with epidemiological investigation and has instructed hospitals around the country to prepare to reopen their COVID-19 wards. The bill resuming the national spy agencyís involvement in contact tracing, unanimously backed by the Cabinet, will move ahead to the national legislature despite opposition by the head of the agency. While reopening has been mostly frozen, cultural events accommodating up to 250 people were permitted starting June 21. Intercity rail services restarted on June 22 with a cap of 500 passengers on each train while only about 30% of the approved capacity was utilized. Strict travel restrictions apply and travelers must also book their places online. Multiple neighborhoods have been designated as restricted areas and put under partial lockdown for a week long duration. Within these neighborhoods, gatherings of more than 50 people will be prohibited. Schools will also be shut in some neighborhoods. The governmentís attempt to force teachers to work into July to recoup missed classes was denied by the court on June 18. School children will have their vacation start by the end of June.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has witnessed an uptick in new cases over recent weeks, occasionally exceeding 200 confirmed cases per day. Many of the increases are concentrated in schools, sending thousands of students and teachers home for quarantine. Big cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem continue to be transmission hotspots. The Israeli health ministry has been permitted to accept Gilead Sciencesí donation of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. While all other reopening plans have been frozen, the cap on the number of people attending weddings and some religious rites was raised to 250 people on June 14. A phone number list of all participants must be kept for 20 days. Other events can only accommodate a maximum of 50 people, as previously established. Schools continue to be open to all students. The government is considering re-imposing some restrictive measures, about which few details have been provided.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After a sustained drop in the daily infection rate, Israel has seen a surge of infections by more than 800 new cases in the past week, especially in schools. Increased enforcement has been ordered to stop large gatherings and mandate mask-wearing. On June 9, the Israeli Health Minister set the daily test target at 30,000. At the same time, serological tests have been formally launched this week, aiming at testing 70,000 citizens. There has also been rising concern about simultaneous waves of COVID-19 and influenza infections this winter, due to a global race for flu vaccines. The involvement of a national spy agency in contact tracing and monitoring has been halted without another bill legislating how it would continue to operate after three months. Seeing a spike in new cases, the government has decided to freeze plans for further reopening, while the number of participants allowed at events was raised to 250 people. Concert venues will resume later. The scheduled return of train services on June 8 is postponed. People are urged to stick to three basic principles: physical distancing, wearing masks and hygiene. The government has decided that the resumption of in-person schooling will not be affected even with recent outbreaks. While many university studies are online, some foreign university students have been returning, dependent upon following the mandatory two-week quarantine on campus. Borders remain closed to foreign travellers.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has seen an uptick in case over the past week, with daily increases occasionally exceeding 100. A cluster of outbreaks at schools have aroused nationwide concerns, sending thousands of students and teachers home. After a month of delays, the widespread antibody testing started last week to help determine the populationís exposure to the virus. A pilot program was launched in regions with high infection rates. Some 70,000 people are set to be tested initially. Early results indicated that the infection rate might be greater than previously thought, with a greater chance of carriers with no symptoms.  As of May 30, drive-in compounds have been used at multiple locations to conduct testing on designated people. To help reach their target of 100,000 tests per day, various companies are working on new testing kits that produce results within a minute. As reopening progresses, some of the last remaining businesses that were closed are now permitted to resume, this includes restaurants, hotels, pools and other establishments. Temperature checks are required before entering restaurants. Places like cinemas are set to open in mid-June. Menís professional soccer resumed on May 30 without spectators. All schools resumed full activities as of May 31. An order was signed to allow higher education systems to have increased activities like in-person lessons and examinations. Universities and colleges are displeased with the lack of preparation time.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has maintained a low level of new COVID-19 infections - fewer than 30 per day - and very few new deaths. A ministerial committee has been established as the supreme coordinating body to handle the pandemic and formulate plans for a possible second wave. The Israeli cabinet decided to limit the involvement of spy agencies in contact tracing only to infected people on May 24, stating the priority of epidemiological investigation. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, swimming pools, hotels and tourist attractions can resume operations, conditional on the observance of physical distancing, hygiene rules, and wearing masks. Seating in food courts in malls is still restricted. The physical distancing requirement in museums has been halved to 1 visitor per 7 square meters. Up to 50 people can be present in gatherings in open areas. Bus operation at 75% capacity was permitted this week, and trains will resume full activities from June 8. 2 passengers are allowed to join the driver in a private vehicle. There are now no specific restrictions on the number of workers at the workplace as long as infection prevention rules are followed, and a maximum of 50 people can be present at professional meetings. The entry ban for university and religious academic program students who do not hold Israeli passports has been relaxed to facilitate studies completion, and the educational institutions involved have to support studentsí self-isolation.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a steady decline in new cases over the past two weeks, Israel has continued to amend emergency regulations to enable further reopening. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, clubs, swimming pools, and hotels will be opened. Extracurricular activities will also be allowed. Museums are being permitted to open without interactive activities involving direct contact. Events in open areas are allowed to be held, and up to 50 people can attend mass gatherings. Students are currently alternating between in-person and remote teaching. A school will be closed if any confirmed case is discovered. Physical distancing, wearing masks, and practising hygiene remain the key principles for relaxation.</p>
