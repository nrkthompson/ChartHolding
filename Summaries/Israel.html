  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Daily new infections in Israel are now approaching 2,000. The Health Ministry is planning to allow 8 to 10 samples to be examined at once and conduct individual tests if the batch is positive. This is to cut down on testing time and to allow for more samples to be tested. On July 14, the Israeli Health Ministry admitted under pressure that more than 12,000 citizens had been mistakenly sent into quarantine after being flagged by the country’s phone tracking system. Nurses are set to go on strike on July 20 over heavy workload and labour shortages. Israel is under immediate risk of reaching its healthcare capacity, with some saying they could do so in as little as three weeks. Mass protests have broken out against the Prime Minister and the government’s economic policy during the pandemic. Reports have also suggested that there is considerable tension among top officials in the government over the handling of the pandemic. A series of new restrictions came into effect on July 17. Gyms and studios are closed again after the legislature overturned the government’s decision to reopen outdoor public pools and gyms on July 13. Eateries are only allowed to offer takeaway services, but the implementation of this restriction was postponed to July 21 due to widespread threats to defy government orders. Indoor gatherings may not have more than 10 people, but there can be up to 20 people outdoors. All stores, shopping malls, open-air markets, hair salons, libraries, petting zoos, museums, pools, tourist attractions, and cable cars will be forced to close on weekends.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel is experiencing an extremely high rate of transmission. The country reported a record-high 1,684 new infections on July 10, with new cases tripling from two weeks ago. The number of active cases has gone up by 500% since June 7. A number of government officials have also been in self-isolation after exposure to infected persons. The Health Ministry has told hospitals to prepare for a coming influx of patients. Facing criticism over the government’s handling of the pandemic, the Prime Minister acknowledged that some reopening measures were premature. More neighbourhoods are being put under seven-day lockdowns, including parts of Jerusalem. Citizens have been warned about a possible second nationwide lockdown if daily new cases exceed 2,000. The Health Ministry is reportedly planning to tighten the testing criteria to relieve the burden on the overwhelmed testing system. Asymptomatic people will no longer be able to get tested, and the ability of family physicians to provide referrals for tests has been reduced. A controversial law was passed on July 7, allowing the government to impose restrictions immediately and seek parliament approval afterwards. The reopening process is being reversed. Gatherings with more than 20 individuals are prohibited in all cases. Restaurants have been forced to limit their indoor and outdoor capacity. Cultural institutions, event halls, clubs, bars, gyms and public swimming pools are now closed. Summer schools, camps and youth activities are not allowed for students higher than fourth grade. Buses are limited to a maximum of 20 people each.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new infections reached 1,130 on July 3, having doubled from a week prior. More neighborhoods have been designated as “restricted areas” and placed under partial lockdown. The prime minister urged public health officials to reduce the time needed for an epidemiological investigation to 48 hours and to shorten the period of test delivery to 12 hours. The system for epidemiological investigation is reported to be overwhelmed by the surge of infections. On July 1, the Israeli parliament approved a proposal to have the national intelligence agency track the cellphones of virus carriers for the next three weeks. The new law allows the agency to access an individual’s phone location data for the 14 days prior to their diagnosis. The government decided to tighten some restrictions on June 29. Outdoor gatherings of more than 50 individuals and indoor gatherings of more than 20 are now prohibited, with the exception of cultural events capped at 250. All businesses and services continue to operate when complying with physical distancing and hygiene rules. People are asked to refrain from visiting their relatives in high-risk groups. University and college exams will be held remotely, and at least 30 percent of employees in the public sector must work from home.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel’s new infections have been skyrocketing and reached 532 new cases per day on June 24. The total active case count has exceeded 5,000, doubling that number two weeks before. Officials predict a sharp rise in the coming few days with as many as 1,000 new daily cases. The Corona Cabinet decided upon a series of immediate measures on June 22, including: establishing a centralized enforcement authority, increasing fines, continuing protection at centers for the elderly, evaluating return to work in self-contained shifts and approving school activities during the summer vacation. The Israel Defense Force was ordered to open additional quarantine hotels for patients who cannot adequately self-isolate at home. The Health Ministry has allocated a budget to integrate 300 auxiliary workers to assist with epidemiological investigation and has instructed hospitals around the country to prepare to reopen their COVID-19 wards. The bill resuming the national spy agency’s involvement in contact tracing, unanimously backed by the Cabinet, will move ahead to the national legislature despite opposition by the head of the agency. While reopening has been mostly frozen, cultural events accommodating up to 250 people were permitted starting June 21. Intercity rail services restarted on June 22 with a cap of 500 passengers on each train while only about 30% of the approved capacity was utilized. Strict travel restrictions apply and travelers must also book their places online. Multiple neighborhoods have been designated as restricted areas and put under partial lockdown for a week long duration. Within these neighborhoods, gatherings of more than 50 people will be prohibited. Schools will also be shut in some neighborhoods. The government’s attempt to force teachers to work into July to recoup missed classes was denied by the court on June 18. School children will have their vacation start by the end of June.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has witnessed an uptick in new cases over recent weeks, occasionally exceeding 200 confirmed cases per day. Many of the increases are concentrated in schools, sending thousands of students and teachers home for quarantine. Big cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem continue to be transmission hotspots. The Israeli health ministry has been permitted to accept Gilead Sciences’ donation of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. While all other reopening plans have been frozen, the cap on the number of people attending weddings and some religious rites was raised to 250 people on June 14. A phone number list of all participants must be kept for 20 days. Other events can only accommodate a maximum of 50 people, as previously established. Schools continue to be open to all students. The government is considering re-imposing some restrictive measures, about which few details have been provided.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After a sustained drop in the daily infection rate, Israel has seen a surge of infections by more than 800 new cases in the past week, especially in schools. Increased enforcement has been ordered to stop large gatherings and mandate mask-wearing. On June 9, the Israeli Health Minister set the daily test target at 30,000. At the same time, serological tests have been formally launched this week, aiming at testing 70,000 citizens. There has also been rising concern about simultaneous waves of COVID-19 and influenza infections this winter, due to a global race for flu vaccines. The involvement of a national spy agency in contact tracing and monitoring has been halted without another bill legislating how it would continue to operate after three months. Seeing a spike in new cases, the government has decided to freeze plans for further reopening, while the number of participants allowed at events was raised to 250 people. Concert venues will resume later. The scheduled return of train services on June 8 is postponed. People are urged to stick to three basic principles: physical distancing, wearing masks and hygiene. The government has decided that the resumption of in-person schooling will not be affected even with recent outbreaks. While many university studies are online, some foreign university students have been returning, dependent upon following the mandatory two-week quarantine on campus. Borders remain closed to foreign travellers.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has seen an uptick in case over the past week, with daily increases occasionally exceeding 100. A cluster of outbreaks at schools have aroused nationwide concerns, sending thousands of students and teachers home. After a month of delays, the widespread antibody testing started last week to help determine the population’s exposure to the virus. A pilot program was launched in regions with high infection rates. Some 70,000 people are set to be tested initially. Early results indicated that the infection rate might be greater than previously thought, with a greater chance of carriers with no symptoms.  As of May 30, drive-in compounds have been used at multiple locations to conduct testing on designated people. To help reach their target of 100,000 tests per day, various companies are working on new testing kits that produce results within a minute. As reopening progresses, some of the last remaining businesses that were closed are now permitted to resume, this includes restaurants, hotels, pools and other establishments. Temperature checks are required before entering restaurants. Places like cinemas are set to open in mid-June. Men’s professional soccer resumed on May 30 without spectators. All schools resumed full activities as of May 31. An order was signed to allow higher education systems to have increased activities like in-person lessons and examinations. Universities and colleges are displeased with the lack of preparation time.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Israel has maintained a low level of new COVID-19 infections - fewer than 30 per day - and very few new deaths. A ministerial committee has been established as the supreme coordinating body to handle the pandemic and formulate plans for a possible second wave. The Israeli cabinet decided to limit the involvement of spy agencies in contact tracing only to infected people on May 24, stating the priority of epidemiological investigation. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, swimming pools, hotels and tourist attractions can resume operations, conditional on the observance of physical distancing, hygiene rules, and wearing masks. Seating in food courts in malls is still restricted. The physical distancing requirement in museums has been halved to 1 visitor per 7 square meters. Up to 50 people can be present in gatherings in open areas. Bus operation at 75% capacity was permitted this week, and trains will resume full activities from June 8. 2 passengers are allowed to join the driver in a private vehicle. There are now no specific restrictions on the number of workers at the workplace as long as infection prevention rules are followed, and a maximum of 50 people can be present at professional meetings. The entry ban for university and religious academic program students who do not hold Israeli passports has been relaxed to facilitate studies completion, and the educational institutions involved have to support students’ self-isolation.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a steady decline in new cases over the past two weeks, Israel has continued to amend emergency regulations to enable further reopening. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, clubs, swimming pools, and hotels will be opened. Extracurricular activities will also be allowed. Museums are being permitted to open without interactive activities involving direct contact. Events in open areas are allowed to be held, and up to 50 people can attend mass gatherings. Students are currently alternating between in-person and remote teaching. A school will be closed if any confirmed case is discovered. Physical distancing, wearing masks, and practising hygiene remain the key principles for relaxation.</p>
