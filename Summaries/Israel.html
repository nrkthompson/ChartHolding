      Israel’s new infections have been skyrocketing and reached 532 new cases per day on June 24. The total active case count has exceeded 5,000, doubling that number two weeks before. Officials predict a sharp rise in the coming few days with as many as 1,000 new daily cases. The Corona Cabinet decided upon a series of immediate measures on June 22, including: establishing a centralized enforcement authority, increasing fines, continuing protection at centers for the elderly, evaluating return to work in self-contained shifts and approving school activities during the summer vacation. The Israel Defense Force was ordered to open additional quarantine hotels for patients who cannot adequately self-isolate at home. The Health Ministry has allocated a budget to integrate 300 auxiliary workers to assist with epidemiological investigation and has instructed hospitals around the country to prepare to reopen their COVID-19 wards. The bill resuming the national spy agency’s involvement in contact tracing, unanimously backed by the Cabinet, will move ahead to the national legislature despite opposition by the head of the agency. While reopening has been mostly frozen, cultural events accommodating up to 250 people were permitted starting June 21. Intercity rail services restarted on June 22 with a cap of 500 passengers on each train while only about 30% of the approved capacity was utilized. Strict travel restrictions apply and travelers must also book their places online. Multiple neighborhoods have been designated as restricted areas and put under partial lockdown for a week long duration. Within these neighborhoods, gatherings of more than 50 people will be prohibited. Schools will also be shut in some neighborhoods. The government’s attempt to force teachers to work into July to recoup missed classes was denied by the court on June 18. School children will have their vacation start by the end of June.

      Israel has witnessed an uptick in new cases over recent weeks, occasionally exceeding 200 confirmed cases per day. Many of the increases are concentrated in schools, sending thousands of students and teachers home for quarantine. Big cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem continue to be transmission hotspots. The Israeli health ministry has been permitted to accept Gilead Sciences’ donation of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. While all other reopening plans have been frozen, the cap on the number of people attending weddings and some religious rites was raised to 250 people on June 14. A phone number list of all participants must be kept for 20 days. Other events can only accommodate a maximum of 50 people, as previously established. Schools continue to be open to all students. The government is considering re-imposing some restrictive measures, about which few details have been provided.

      After a sustained drop in the daily infection rate, Israel has seen a surge of infections by more than 800 new cases in the past week, especially in schools. Increased enforcement has been ordered to stop large gatherings and mandate mask-wearing. On June 9, the Israeli Health Minister set the daily test target at 30,000. At the same time, serological tests have been formally launched this week, aiming at testing 70,000 citizens. There has also been rising concern about simultaneous waves of COVID-19 and influenza infections this winter, due to a global race for flu vaccines. The involvement of a national spy agency in contact tracing and monitoring has been halted without another bill legislating how it would continue to operate after three months. Seeing a spike in new cases, the government has decided to freeze plans for further reopening, while the number of participants allowed at events was raised to 250 people. Concert venues will resume later. The scheduled return of train services on June 8 is postponed. People are urged to stick to three basic principles: physical distancing, wearing masks and hygiene. The government has decided that the resumption of in-person schooling will not be affected even with recent outbreaks. While many university studies are online, some foreign university students have been returning, dependent upon following the mandatory two-week quarantine on campus. Borders remain closed to foreign travellers.

      Israel has seen an uptick in case over the past week, with daily increases occasionally exceeding 100. A cluster of outbreaks at schools have aroused nationwide concerns, sending thousands of students and teachers home. After a month of delays, the widespread antibody testing started last week to help determine the population’s exposure to the virus. A pilot program was launched in regions with high infection rates. Some 70,000 people are set to be tested initially. Early results indicated that the infection rate might be greater than previously thought, with a greater chance of carriers with no symptoms.  As of May 30, drive-in compounds have been used at multiple locations to conduct testing on designated people. To help reach their target of 100,000 tests per day, various companies are working on new testing kits that produce results within a minute. As reopening progresses, some of the last remaining businesses that were closed are now permitted to resume, this includes restaurants, hotels, pools and other establishments. Temperature checks are required before entering restaurants. Places like cinemas are set to open in mid-June. Men’s professional soccer resumed on May 30 without spectators. All schools resumed full activities as of May 31. An order was signed to allow higher education systems to have increased activities like in-person lessons and examinations. Universities and colleges are displeased with the lack of preparation time.

      Israel has maintained a low level of new COVID-19 infections - fewer than 30 per day - and very few new deaths. A ministerial committee has been established as the supreme coordinating body to handle the pandemic and formulate plans for a possible second wave. The Israeli cabinet decided to limit the involvement of spy agencies in contact tracing only to infected people on May 24, stating the priority of epidemiological investigation. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, swimming pools, hotels and tourist attractions can resume operations, conditional on the observance of physical distancing, hygiene rules, and wearing masks. Seating in food courts in malls is still restricted. The physical distancing requirement in museums has been halved to 1 visitor per 7 square meters. Up to 50 people can be present in gatherings in open areas. Bus operation at 75% capacity was permitted this week, and trains will resume full activities from June 8. 2 passengers are allowed to join the driver in a private vehicle. There are now no specific restrictions on the number of workers at the workplace as long as infection prevention rules are followed, and a maximum of 50 people can be present at professional meetings. The entry ban for university and religious academic program students who do not hold Israeli passports has been relaxed to facilitate studies completion, and the educational institutions involved have to support students’ self-isolation.

      Following a steady decline in new cases over the past two weeks, Israel has continued to amend emergency regulations to enable further reopening. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, clubs, swimming pools, and hotels will be opened. Extracurricular activities will also be allowed. Museums are being permitted to open without interactive activities involving direct contact. Events in open areas are allowed to be held, and up to 50 people can attend mass gatherings. Students are currently alternating between in-person and remote teaching. A school will be closed if any confirmed case is discovered. Physical distancing, wearing masks, and practising hygiene remain the key principles for relaxation.
