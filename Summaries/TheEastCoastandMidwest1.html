      Michigan Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, issued an executive order on May 18th that allowed businesses and restaurants in northern Michigan (border counties with Lake Superior and Sault Ste. Marie) to reopen at reduced capacity (50%) and increased health guidelines on May 22nd. The existing stay-at-home order affecting the rest of the state will remain in effect until May 28th. Illinois remains in Phase 2 of its reopening plan, focusing on flattening the curve by closing non-essential services. Pennsylvania is using a color-coded (red, yellow, green) approach to reopen certain counties. Philadelphia remains "red," meaning stay-at-home orders are enforced; Pittsburgh has moved to yellow, meaning retail stores can reopen, but schools remain closed. New York remains the state with the most daily cases. However, the amount has been consistently decreasing, prompting Governor Cuomo to reopen state beaches ahead of Memorial Day weekend. The governor is also in discussion with major sports teams regarding the resumption of games without spectators. In Maine, bars, nightclubs, and movie theaters remain closed, but restaurants, fitness centers, personal care businesses, and retail stores are open in most counties.
