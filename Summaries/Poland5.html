      Poland’s government has continued easing restrictions related to COVID-19, allowing hotels to fully reopen all of their facilities, including gyms, swimming pools, bars and restaurants, on June 6. On June 12, the Polish-Lithuanian border reopened to citizens and permanent residents of both countries, who can now travel across the border without restrictions. On June 13, Poland further reopened its borders to all Polish citizens and permanent residents travelling to Poland from another EU+ country, while all citizens and permanent residents of the EU+ may travel through Poland without restrictions while in transit to another country. The Polish government has publicly endorsed “ProteGo Safe,” a Polish contact-tracing app now available for download on Android and iOS devices.
