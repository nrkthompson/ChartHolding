      On June 3, the country's death toll surpassed 50,000, putting it behind the US. While experts agree that the peak has passed, the UK still has one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. Nevertheless on June 1, some non-essential businesses, including car showrooms and garden centres, resumed operations. Restaurants and most schools across the Kingdom remain closed with no confirmed date for reopening. Although primary schools were permitted to reopen in England on June 1, only a fifth of schools actually did so with severely low attendance rates. Retail stores are scheduled to reopen on June 15. The contact-tracing app has not launched yet. Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed plans for a mandatory 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK, which will take effect on June 8. The government was criticized by opposition parties for imposing the quarantine period on new arrivals now because they claim that it would have been more effective earlier in the pandemic, and that at this point it could further damage the tourism and airline sectors. Low-cost carrier, RyanAir, called the policy “utterly ineffective” because travellers could still take public transportation home from the airport and go to grocery stores. Notably, the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance did not support the decision. He claims that travel quarantines are effective only when infection rates inside a country have dropped, and when applied to travelers arriving from countries with high rates of transmission. Vallance says this is currently not the case for the UK. While the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland must abide by the quarantine, they will set their own enforcement approaches.
