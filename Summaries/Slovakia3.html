      On June 1, the Slovak government proceeded to the fifth stage of its plan for easing restrictions related to COVID-19. While kindergartens and daycares were already permitted to reopen, primary schools are now also allowed to resume teaching for grades one to five. On June 3, secondary schools were allowed to reopen for final examinations. All retail and catering establishments have been allowed to reopen fully, provided that they are able to maintain a safe distance between patrons and adhere to a strict sanitary regime. All shopping centres, theatres, cinemas, spas, swimming pools and gyms are allowed to reopen according to similar standards. General guidelines on hygiene and physical distancing, such as the obligatory use of facemasks in all public places, continue to apply to most residents. On May 24, the Slovak government announced the release of its contact tracing app, eKaranténa, available on all Android smartphones. Effective immediately, everyone arriving at Slovakia’s border looking to enter or travel throughout the country is required to download and register for the application. iPhone users will be able to download the application after Apple’s approval.
