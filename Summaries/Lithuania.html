  <p style="text-align:justify;">Lithuania reported 776 new cases of COVID-19 on October 26, bringing the country’s total confirmed cases up to 10,949 - over 3000 more than last week. On October 21, the Lithuanian Government approved a three-tiered classification system for individual municipalities based on various epidemiological indicators. The green zone will indicate that the risk of COVID-19 is low, and will include municipalities with less than 25 cases per 100,000 population. The yellow zone will indicate that municipalities should be prepared for an outbreak and some preventative measures, and will include municipalities with less than 50 cases per 100,000 population. Municipalities in the red zone will be subject to a decision regarding the introduction of a local quarantine, which may include restrictions in public life, events, and education, and the mandatory use of personal protective equipment. The red zone includes municipalities with more than 50 cases per 100,000 population. 13 Lithuanian municipalities are currently under quarantine in the red zone.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>

Lithuania’s incidence rate was 90.9 cases per 100 thousand people as of October 19 - increased from 55.7 just 1 week ago. Even if a non-EU country is removed from the affected list, only residents and nationals of EU and EEA countries, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland, can enter Lithuania.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>

As of October 12, isolation will no longer be required for arrivals from Estonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Norway, Germany, Faroe Islands and another 14 countries.

Lithuania’s incidence rate was 55.7 cases per 100 thousand people as of October 9.
