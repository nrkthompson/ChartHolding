      On June 6, the Belgian government announced that it would be providing a free 10 journey rail pass to all residents in an effort to boost domestic tourism and the economy. The National Rail Company was concerned about these measures since social distancing on public transport is a key challenge as the country reopens. The lack of consultation raises questions related to safety, social distancing, and sanitation for travellers and staff.48 Phase 3 of Belgium’s reopening plan began on June 8, and almost all businesses are now operating including hotels, cafes and restaurants. Eateries can operate at 70% capacity and must maintain 1.5 metres between tables. While lakes and ponds are open, swimming pools remain closed across the country.49 On June 15, Belgium will reopen its borders to citizens within the Schengen area.50 Regional ministers, MPs, and local councillors were among the 10,000 people in Brussels who attended the Black Lives Matter demonstrations on June 7. Scientific experts are asking people who attended to strictly follow hygienic measures for 15 days and are expecting to see an impact on Belgium’s figures in the coming weeks from the protests.51 In response to demonstrations, the cabinet said that leaders will be announcing guidelines for protesting without breaking social-distancing and COVID-19 sanitary rules.52
