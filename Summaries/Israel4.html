      After a sustained drop in the daily infection rate, Israel has seen a surge of infections by more than 800 new cases in the past week, especially in schools. Increased enforcement has been ordered to stop large gatherings and mandate mask-wearing. On June 9, the Israeli Health Minister set the daily test target at 30,000. At the same time, serological tests have been formally launched this week, aiming at testing 70,000 citizens. There has also been rising concern about simultaneous waves of COVID-19 and influenza infections this winter, due to a global race for flu vaccines. The involvement of a national spy agency in contact tracing and monitoring has been halted without another bill legislating how it would continue to operate after three months. Seeing a spike in new cases, the government has decided to freeze plans for further reopening, while the number of participants allowed at events was raised to 250 people. Concert venues will resume later. The scheduled return of train services on June 8 is postponed. People are urged to stick to three basic principles: physical distancing, wearing masks and hygiene. The government has decided that the resumption of in-person schooling will not be affected even with recent outbreaks. While many university studies are online, some foreign university students have been returning, dependent upon following the mandatory two-week quarantine on campus. Borders remain closed to foreign travellers.
