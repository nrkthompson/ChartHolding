      As of May 25, Greece entered phase 4 of it's unlocking strategy, easing restrictions related to tourism, restaurants, shopping centres, and ferry services. Effective June 1, indoor shopping centres can reopen, and restaurants can reopen with outdoor seating only. Ferry services have resumed to all Greek islands and mainland ports for travellers but not yet to foreign tourists. Passenger ferries will operate at 50% capacity with strict physical distancing measures and health and safety protocols in place. On June 1, year-round hotels will reopen with seasonal hotels to follow on June 15, the same day some direct international flights from Athens International Airport will resume. However, many direct international flights will not resume until July 1. Greece will allow between 20-25 countries to visit without quarantine. Currently, citizens from all EU countries except Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands can fly into Athens but are subject to a 14 day quarantine. Visits from Britain and other non-EU countries are currently restricted, including Canada and the United States.
