      On May 20, the Slovak government proceeded to the fourth and final stage of their plan for easing restrictions related to COVID-19. All shopping centres have been allowed to reopen, provided that they are able to maintain at least 15m distance between shoppers, while cinemas, theatres, and other mass gatherings are being allowed to take place with up to 100 participants. Indoor and outdoor catering establishments are being allowed to accept customers with a maximum of two patrons per table, and a distance of 2 metres between each table. Public sports grounds, fitness centres, and swimming pools have all been allowed to reopen without the use of change rooms and showers. General guidelines on hygiene and physical distancing, such as the obligatory use of facemasks in all public places, continue to apply to most residents.
