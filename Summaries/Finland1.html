      Finnish schools reopened this week for all students, though a small number opted to stay home for the rest of the school year. Outbreaks were reported at numerous schools across the country, infecting both students and staff. While the affected classes were sent home for distance learning, the schools remained open after hygiene procedures were initiated. Finland has eased restrictions for those who are over 70 years old, saying that they are able to see their relatives as long as they maintain a distance of two metres and wear a mask. The Finnish government outlined the regulations that will be in place for restaurants and bars after they are allowed to open on June 1st. Each establishment must stop serving alcohol at 10pm, and is limited to half of their normal capacity for the time being. Leaders in the hospitality industry have voiced some pushback to these policies, saying that a capacity that is 75% normal would give restaurant owners more breathing room on their expenses, which are expected to be paid in full.
