      The daily increase of cases in Australia has stayed at a very low level for weeks, while most new infections are imported and where people were placed under quarantine upon arrival. At least two cases have been confirmed in people who attended mass protests inspired by George Floyd, so health authorities urge people to stay vigilant. The government is considering shortening the quarantine time period for international students and business travellers, as well as for other travellers from countries with low rates of Covid-19 infection, such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea.168 States have accelerated lifting their restrictions. Most businesses and services have resumed with physical distancing and hygiene measures. Businesses in most states are allowed to accommodate between 50 and 100 customers by next week while up to 20 people can gather at homes.169 The prime minister announced on June 12 that when states move to the third stage of their COVD-19 reopening plan, stadiums with capacities of 40,000 or less will be able to seat 25% of their capacity.170 All students have physically returned to school. More states are now easing their border restrictions, while 3 states have already lifted controls completely. Interstate travels are expected to be possible nationwide in mid-July. The federal government is adding pressure to the states by raising court challenges against their border control.171 Meanwhile, the Australian Tourism Minister has said that national borders are likely to stay closed until 2021.
