      The UK is still in its lockdown phase. Unlike most European countries, the UK is still reporting over 2,000 cases and hundreds of deaths daily. At this time, people across the UK must remain in their houses, unless they are shopping for essential needs or exercising. PM Johnson's government is focusing on building a new track-and-trace system prior to reopening the economy. The system uses Bluetooth tracing to inform the user whether or not they have been in close contact with another user who has tested positive. The at-risk user will be encouraged to stay at home for two weeks, and be given statutory sick pay. The launch date is not yet announced, but the country's Test and Trace Chief confirmed the system will not be fully operational at a local level until the end of June, four weeks after lockdown restrictions are eased. This has prompted opposition politicians to call the strategy "high risk." Moreover, scientists have warned that the app is not a "magic bullet" and could prevent only between 5% and 15% of infections. PM Johnson is expected to ease further restrictions next week, while Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to develop and follow their own reopening plans.
