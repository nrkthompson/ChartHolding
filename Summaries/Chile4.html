      Chile has one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in Latin America and to ensure comparability and accuracy in their count, they will now include information found on death certificates. After approximately 76 days under partial or total lockdown, Chile’s hospitals are close to collapsing. 75 people, two of whom had tested positive for COVID-19, were detained and face fines for violating lockdown regulations. Chile is making permits in regions that are under lockdown stricter to deter the abuse of permits and will be extending lockdowns in Chile. Chile is increasing the number of hospital transport vans, the number of critical care beds in hospitals and the number of sanitary residences used for self-isolation. The government donated masks, gloves and sanitizer to a group of taxi drivers in the Metropolitan Region. The government supported the University of Chile’s launch of a free traceability course based on the John Hopkins contact tracing course. On July 31, the National Professional Football Association intends to resume football games after three to four weeks of training camp.
