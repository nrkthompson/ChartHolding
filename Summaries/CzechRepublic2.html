      On May 25, the Czech government proceeded to the fourth and final phase of its reopening plan, allowing all eateries, hotels, spas, and public swimming pools to resume business. Mass gatherings of up to 300 people are being allowed in both indoor and outdoor settings, while professional and amateur athletes are also being permitted to organize training with up to 300 participants. Up to 15 primary school students are being allowed to meet at one time in order to participate in optional group activities, hobbies, and clubs. Some post-secondary classes and group activities are also being allowed to take place in-person, provided that there are no more than 15 students in a room at one time. Finally, all hospitals, walk-in clinics, and social therapy workshops have reopened for Czech residents under the age of 50, with the possibility of visits to social and medical inpatient facilities. Other activities and businesses are expected to resume throughout the month of June, depending on the countryâ€™s epidemiological situation at that time. Despite ending its official nationwide state of emergency on May 17, the Czech government has left a number of emergency measures in place. All Czech residents travelling outside of their homes, with some exceptions, are still required to cover their faces using a scarf or mask until further notice.
