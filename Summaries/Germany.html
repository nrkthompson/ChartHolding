  <h5>February 22, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On February 19, 9,113 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Germany. COVID-19 cases are rising rapidly in the German border town of Flensburg, with half linked to the UK variant. Flensburg's situation may be a worrying indicator of what the rest of Germany could soon look like. As a result, Denmark partially and temporarily closed its border with Germany to stop the spread of COVID-19 cases; Flensburg sits close to the border with the Scandinavian country.</p> 
  <h5>February 15, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On February 10, 8,072 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Germany. On February 11, the government decided to temporarily reinstate border controls along its southeastern frontier after designating the Czech Republic and parts of Austria as mutation areas due to their high number of variant COVID-19 cases. The temporary border controls and entry restrictions will come into effect on February 14. Travellers coming from certain areas of Austria or the Czech Republic will have to provide proof of a negative test in order to enter Germany. The federal government and state leaders also agreed to extend the nationwide shutdown until March 7, beyond the previous February 14 deadline. Though overall infection numbers in the country are declining, concern is rising about new variants. On March 1, hairdressers will be allowed to reopen under strict hygiene conditions and schools and daycare centres may gradually reopen depending on the decisions of individual states.</p> 
  <h5>February 8, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 14,211 to 2,252,001 according to data released by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) on Thursday. The health minister announced on February 5 that the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions could be lifted before the spring. After loosening restrictions during the summer months, Germany went into a partial lockdown in November -- closing bars, restaurants, and cultural and sporting facilities. Schools and non-essential shops were added to the list in mid-December. In January, the government brought in tighter rules on mask-wearing and working from home amid concerns over new virus variants. Federal and state leaders will meet on February 10 to review Germany’s current lockdown, which is set to expire on February 7. However, a group of frontline medical professionals has called on the government to keep the measures in place until the end of February.</p> 
  <h5>February 1, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On February 1, 11,192 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Germany. Effective January 28, Germany restricted entry for travellers from Britain, Brazil, Portugal, and South Africa, as concerns of more contagious COVID-19 variants rise. The government is looking at stricter border checks, "but also reducing air travel to Germany to almost zero, as Israel is currently doing." Germany's vaccine commission, STIKO, said that AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine should only be administered to people aged 64 and under. The panel of medical experts cite a lack of data regarding the vaccine's effectiveness for older people.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On January 21, German health officials reported 20,398 new COVID-19 infections, with the number of infections per 100,000 residents in seven days at 119, the lowest level since November 1. Despite a slowdown in the rate of infections, Germany’s health minister announced the continuation of stringent lockdown conditions to prevent a worsening of the current situation. On January 22, Germany detected its first case of a newly discovered Brazilian COVID-19 variant. Experts from Germany's Robert Koch Institute say the Brazilian mutation is similar to the South African variant, which is seen as more contagious than the original virus. Germany has already imposed travel restrictions on people from affected nations and are asking for negative COVID-19 tests prior to departure.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Germany surpassed 2 million COVID-19 infections on January 16 and the death toll reached almost 45,000. The rise in cases is attributed to the new British strain of the virus and has led the Chancellor to announce an extension to the current COVID-19 measures for another 8 to 10 weeks. Under the lockdown, schools, non-essential shops and services, eateries, leisure, and cultural facilities are closed. Private gatherings are permitted to include a maximum of one other person not living in the household. For districts with a 7-day incidence of more than 200 new infections per 100,000 residents, movement is restricted to a 15 km radius around one’s residence -- unless there is a valid reason to travel further. Effective January 11, people arriving in Germany from risk areas must take a COVID-19 test prior to their arrival. Additionally, a mandatory 10-day quarantine is in effect -- but can be reduced to five days if the individual tests negative.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value has decreased since last week and is now 1.04. The countryÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has increased slightly to 25,000 daily cases. Numerous clusters have been linked to private gatherings, nursing homes, and religious gatherings. While cases in the younger population are falling, they are still rising among older people. Germany recorded more than 10,000 COVID-19 deaths in December and is on course to see the number of fatalities double from last month. Comparatively, the death toll was 5,800 in November, 964 in October, and 190 in September. On December 20, Germany suspended all UK-bound flights amid growing concerns of an "out of control" new variant of COVID-19, which is spreading at a much faster pace. On December 21, the country introduced restrictions for South African flights because of the same variant.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value has increased slightly since last week and is now at 1.12.  The countryÕs 7-day moving average of new cases increased to 22,000 daily cases. GermanyÕs intensive care unit capacity is also at a critical level: only 5% to 10% of intensive care beds are available in some parts of the country. The chancellor and GermanyÕs 16 state premiers have come to an agreement to increase restrictions across the country. On December 16, nonessential shops and services, schools and daycare centers will close until January 10. Religious events may take place only if participants register, adhere to strict hygiene rules, and not sing. States are planning to ease stricter contact restrictions for December 24 to 26 so that close family members can spend Christmas together -- with up to 4 adults from different households mixing if they are immediate family. Production issues at the Pfizer-BioNTech facilities in Germany have delayed the distribution of the first 3 million vaccines until the end of January.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value increased above the 1.0 target and is now 1.10. The countryÕs 7-day moving average of new cases increased slightly to 18,500. Numerous clusters have been identified in private households and nursing and long-term care homes. Although the lockdown-lite restrictions fended off an exponential surge, experts and politicians say that they are insufficient to decrease the number of cases. The state premier of Bavaria urged Germany's federal and state leaders to hold another top-level meeting before Christmas to discuss tightening restrictions. Currently, the lockdown-lite measures will remain in effect till January 10, with a reprieve during the Christmas period that lifts the five-person maximum for private gatherings to ten. The health minister warned that the rollout of vaccinations will be limited in the first few months, estimating that there would be three million doses in January. Health workers, the elderly and those at high risk of severe complications from COVID-19 will get those doses. The minister expects that by summer it would be possible to carry out vaccinations in doctors' clinics and that the country could be Òout of the woodsÓ by the fall of 2021.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value has decreased to 0.95. The countryÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has decreased slightly to 17,500 cases. Private gatherings remain the largest driver of transmission. Officials say the lockdown-lite measures have thus far succeeded in halting the surge. The chancellor and 16 state premiers came to a decision last week to extend the shutdown until at least December 20 to try to bring the numbers down to below 50 per 100,000 inhabitants each week; there are currently 138 cases per 100,000. Additional restrictions were also announced last week. From December 1, private gatherings will be limited to five people, but this number will rise to ten, not counting children, between December 24 and January 1. Masks will become mandatory for students in the seventh grade (12-13 years) and up while at school. Germany is seeking a coordinated EU approach to keep ski resorts shut in Alpine countries to limit the spread.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs seven-day R-value has slightly increased to 1.07; however, the countryÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has maintained its plateau at around 18,500 cases. Private gatherings seem to be the largest driver of transmission. Official data show that the number of COVID-19 patients in German ICUs has climbed from 267 on September 21 to 3,615 as of November 21 -- a more than 13-fold increase in the space of just two months; 6,107 ICU beds remain vacant. The chancellor met with the 16 state premiers to discuss stricter lockdowns. However, she did not have support among state leaders for new restrictions, postponing any decision until a meeting next week. Current restrictions include contacts reduced to a maximum of two households and no more than 10 people, restaurants and bars closed apart from take-out, and unnecessary travel discouraged but not banned. Schools and nurseries are open. The chancellor was hoping to decrease the household number to one, and to introduce facemasks at schools of all levels.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value has slightly increased to 1.03; however, the countryÕs 7-day moving average of new cases has plateaued at around 18,500 cases. Although for a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear, numerous clusters are connected to private gatherings in households and in community institutions, such as nursing and long-term care homes. The Chancellor is due to meet with state premiers on November 16 to discuss additional restrictions, such as dramatically reducing the number of people at household gatherings and compulsory mask wearing for school students. Currently, bars and restaurants are closed, while schools and shops remain open. The federal minister of health thinks that itÕs Òtoo early to sayÓ whether the country will extend its partial lockdown beyond the month of November.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value has decreased below the 1.0 threshold, and is now at 0.97. On November 6, the country confirmed 22,250 cases -- a record number. Due to the low R-value, it is expected that the number of cases will decrease this week. Numerous clusters are connected to private gatherings, celebrations, religious events, along with settings like long-term care homes. Last week, the federal government announced a Òlockdown light,Ó with the aim of decreasing the number of new infections to about 50 cases per 100,000 people over a 7-day period -- so that local public health offices could once again trace all contacts. There are currently 139 cases per 100,000 over a 7-day period, and the government is unable to trace 75% of new cases. There have been no added restrictions since last week, but the chancellor is urging Germans to abide by hygiene and distancing rules so that health care services donÕt collapse as the country records more ICU admissions of COVID-19 patients than at any point since the pandemic began. German officials condemned the actions of 20,000 people who demonstrated against the new COVID-19 restrictions on November 8 by purposefully jamming together in a city square largely without wearing masks.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value decreased to 1.13, but Germany is grappling with a record breaking 7-day moving average of 15,000 new cases per day. Numerous clusters are connected to private gatherings, celebrations, religious events, educational settings, and nursing and long-term care homes, but authorities are currently unable to trace the source of three-quarters of infections. A deal struck between Chancellor Merkel and the premiers of all states will put Germans under Òlockdown light.Ó As of November 2, all restaurants and bars will be closed, meetings in public will be restricted to less than ten people from two households, and all recreational centers, such as pools and gyms, will be shut. Unlike spring, schools, non-essential shops and hairdressers will remain open, churches will be allowed to hold services, and protests will not be banned. Germans have been asked to refrain from making non-essential journeys and hotels are barred from accommodating people on tourist trips. Despite the restrictions, the majority of Germans allegedly support the measures.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value has increased to 1.39 and has not decreased below the 1.0 target since the beginning of September. Unsurprisingly, Germany recorded record numbers of cases this week, with a 7-day moving average of 9,500 new cases. Case clusters continue to be reported from family/friend events and nursing homes. Throughout the past week, Chancellor Angela Merkel and government officials from other levels of government have urged citizens to cut down on socializing, encouraging them to stay at home instead. Even though the chancellor and all 16 state premiers agreed on new metrics and restrictions two weeks ago, some experts are starting to call for a return to the nationwide restrictions seen at the start of the pandemic, due to the patchwork of regulations that each state is enforcing. Berlin, one of GermanyÕs hotspots, implemented new restrictions on October 24, requiring face masks in markets and on 10 particularly busy streets, in shopping malls and in queues. This caused thousands to protest openly defying the rules and calling for the end of restrictions.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value remains steady at 1.35. After a successful control of cases in September, the country has officially joined most other European countries in reporting some of the highest daily case counts since the pandemic began. At more than 7,000 cases per day, case clusters are being reported particularly in the context of family events and in nursing homes. On October 15, Chancellor Merkel and the premiers of all 16 states agreed on limiting private gatherings to 15 attendees, mandatory masks outside of the house, and a curfew for bars and restaurants from 11 p.m. in areas with a weekly rate of more than 35 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. This is lower than last weekÕs threshold of 50 cases per 100,000 because it does not take long for cases to increase from 35 to 50. Once a threshold of 50 new cases per 100,000 people is exceeded, even tougher restrictions will apply: private gatherings will be limited to 10 people and bars and clubs will have to shut. Nevertheless, the government announced on October 17 that its hospitals were ready once again to admit COVID-19 patients from elsewhere in Europe.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs 7-day R-value substantially increased this week from 1.14 to 1.37. On October 9, the federation confirmed almost 5,000 cases, a figure not seen since the beginning of April. This increase has been attributed to clusters reported in the context of religious or family events, nursing homes, facilities for asylum-seekers and refugees, and meat-processing plants. The federal government reached an agreement with mayors of Germany's 11 largest cities on strict measures that will kick in locally if the rate of infection goes above 50 per 100,000 residents over a period of seven days. However, the plan was vague, listing possibilities of restrictions instead of requirements for each city; possibilities include stricter rules on wearing masks and social distancing, introducing curfews in the hospitality sector, and tougher limits on public and private gatherings. As BerlinÕs ICU occupancy rate doubled in the last two weeks, all businesses, including bars, restaurants, and late-night shops now have to close between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. until at least October 31.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs case count is steadily increasing, as the federationÕs 7-day R-value increased from last week by 0.1 (currently at 1.14). The federal government remains on watch, but it has thus far not brought in any new restrictions nationwide. Germany lifted its blanket warning against travelling to all countries outside the European Union on October 1; under new criteria, warnings will be issued for regions across the world when infections rise above the level of 50 cases per 100,000 people over a week. Travelers from regions below that threshold will be able to return to Germany without going into quarantine pending a negative test. Thus far, Germany's biggest cities have collected more than Û3 million in penalties from violators of COVID-19 restrictions. Despite being one of the most open countries in Europe and adopting extremely local lockdowns, thousands of Germans protested against COVID-19 restrictions over the weekend.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">GermanyÕs case count seems to have plateaued at around 1750-2000 per day. The federationÕs 7-day R-value decreased from last week (currently at 1.02) but is still slightly above the 1.0 target. The government has thus far not brought in any new restrictions nationwide, including border restrictions. Last week, health minister Jens Spahn announced a plan for new "fever outpatient clinics" where those with symptoms can go to be tested for COVID-19 and receive treatment. It is hoped that these outpatient clinics would reduce the number of infections in the rest of the healthcare system.These clinics will be able to accommodate a second wave in cases and limit infection rates. Apart from an alcohol ban in MunichÕs Theresienwiese, where the Oktoberfest is usually held, the Bavarian State Premier Markus Sšder is planning on imposing a mandatory mask policy as inebriated crowds begin gathering in the square.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although Germany continues to experience a resurgence in the number of cases, it is currently not at the same level of intensity as France and Spain. The country’s 7-day R-value is 1.17, slightly above the 1.0 target. The 7-day moving average of new cases is 1,740, a steady increase from early September. The federal government has not brought in any new restrictions nationwide, but several German cities and towns imposed their own rules after exceeding 50 cases per 100,000 citizens. For example, Munich is set to ban groups of more than 6 people meeting up in private. Indeed, September 19 should have marked the start of Oktoberfest celebrations in Munich, but events were canceled due to the pandemic. Authorities announced an alcohol ban on Theresienwiese -- where the main celebration is usually held -- to stop would-be revelers from hosting replacement parties. Although the number of new daily cases in Germany is rising, schools have not been identified as a driver of infections. The key factor is keeping community transmission rates low and having a rapid contact tracing mechanism in the inevitable case of outbreaks.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although Germany is experiencing a slight resurgence in the number of cases, the daily cases have not reached the levels seen in March and April. The country’s 7-day R-value -- currently at 0.95 -- is still below the 1.0 target. The 7-day moving average of new cases is 1,280, a steady decrease from late August. All schools across the country are now open. Each state has their own rules and regulations regarding mask usage and social distancing. Several states in northern Germany are lifting restrictions on prostitution; North Rhine-Westphalia is now allowing sex workers to resume work. The decision comes in the wake of several court cases filed by sex workers, who argued the restrictions unfairly discriminated against them and noted that it was not clear that the risk of infection was much higher during sexual acts than at private gatherings of up to 150 people.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Germany’s 7-day R-value is 0.97 -- finally below the 1.0 target. Nevertheless, the 7-day moving average of new cases is currently 1,356. Similar to other European countries, the steady rise in cases is being attributed to private parties. Each state has its own limit on the number of people who can attend small private parties and events at large venues. While Hamburg caps parties at 50 people, Berlin currently allows up to 500 people at gatherings. A main topic this week will be possible federal curbs on private parties and celebrations--in order to standardize the rules. Experts said that not enough people are using the country's coronavirus tracking app for it to be effective. Even though more than 17 million people have downloaded the app, the number of downloads needs to double for the country to be prepared for a second wave. Hundreds of students and teachers have been in quarantine, two weeks after school reopenings in Berlin: COVID-19 cases were reported in 41 out of 825 schools in the district. Critics argue that health guidelines are too lax in Berlin since students are allowed to take their masks off at their desk.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Germany’s 7-day R-value is 1.13--still above the 1.0 target. For the first time since May 5, the 7-day moving average of new cases is above 1,000 per day. In the early days of the pandemic, the average age of people infected was 50; it is now 34. As mentioned last week, education delivery is devolved to each state. Days after the start of the new school year in Berlin last week, COVID-19 cases were reported in a number of schools--leading to closures. The GEW teachers union said that several reopening plans were "negligent." Older teachers and those with chronic lung or heart problems are also afraid to attend classes out of fear of contracting the infection. Although no official closure policies have been implemented, Health Minister Jens Spahn has warned that stricter event bans on weddings and large gatherings could be put in place amid the surge in cases.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Compared to last week, Germany’s 7-day R-value has increased to 1.17. On August 10, millions of students across Germany, including in Berlin, go back to school. Each state is taking different measures, mostly regarding face masks. The least restrictive state is Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which has no mask requirement but does apply the “remaining in your cohort all day” principle. Two schools in the state closed on Friday due to COVID infections among students. The most restrictive state, North Rhine-Westphalia, is enforcing a mask requirement in class. Berlin requires face masks as students enter the schools and in the hallways, but not in class.  German firms in many sectors (e.g., service, manufacturing, and leisure) believe that current COVID-19 restrictions will remain in place until April 2021.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After a few weeks of having an R0 above 1, Germany’s current 7-day R-value is estimated at 1.00. Although most of the economy is open, modifications such as social-distancing rules and wearing masks on public transit and in shops remain in place--especially since there has been a recent uptick in daily cases. On August 1, approximately 20,000 mask-less protestors gathered in Berlin to protest against COVID restrictions. This caused many German politicians to call for more restrictions on the right to demonstrate. This week, the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is the first German state to start the school year. Most students will return to the classroom in “cohorts” that will spend the whole day together. If one person in the cohort gets infected, only the cohort (as opposed to the whole school) will quarantine.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After weeks of progress amidst a local outbreak in the northwest, the state premier of Saxony, Michael Kretschmer thinks the "second wave is already here," as the daily number of cases increases. German health authorities have warned that the seven-day R rate is around 1.2, while the seven day average of daily cases increased from 430 to 560 in one week. According to RKI, more than 60% of the new cases are recorded in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and in the south-western state of Baden-Württember. Health officials say that new clusters have been traced to larger celebrations, leisure activities and places of work, or from visits to community and health facilities. The increasing number of cases is also being traced to returning travellers. Media outlets have reported that Germany's COVID-19 tracing app was not working properly for up to five weeks due to an issue affecting millions of Android and Apple devices, where some operating systems had blocked the app from running in the background in order to save power, preventing the app from using its bluetooth function. German authorities plan to set up testing stations at airports to encourage people arriving from high-risk countries to get tested.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On the weekend of July 18, Germany’s 7-day R-value edged over 1.2, raising the alarm that this could be the start of a second wave. July 16 saw the biggest daily case increase (534) since June. Following the localized lockdown in North-Rhine Westphalia last month, the federal government, in coordination with the state governments, is introducing tougher and even more targeted measures to contain outbreaks. Instead of locking down regions or districts of 100,000 residents, councils will have power to lockdown a certain hotspot or area. Much of German news coverage of COVID this week has been regarding the EU summit on the $2.8 trillion European economic recovery package, initiated by France and Germany. A German study tested for COVID antibodies in 2,000 schoolchildren to see the infection rate in schools. The rate was very low, prompting some states, such as Saxony, to announce that schools would reopen at the end of August with some restrictions such as mask-wearing and social distancing where possible.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Germany’s 7-day reproduction rate is 0.91. It successfully concluded the local lockdown in the North-Rhine Westphalia region last week. Local lockdowns are lifted if total active cases fall below a threshold of 50 per 100,000 people over a seven-day period. Accordingly, authorities lifted the lockdown in Warendorf on July 1. However, State Premier Armin Laschet decided to extend the city of Gütersloh’s lockdown for another week because case numbers remained high there. Although set to expire at midnight on July 7, the Higher Administrative Court in Münster ordered the end of the lockdown measures on July 6 with immediate effect--saying the government had had time to bring in targeted rules. Additionally, the meatpacking company at the centre of this COVID-19 outbreak came under fire from politicians on July 12 for requesting government support to cover quarantined workers’ pay. After 1,500 Tonnies' workers were infected, the company was forced to close until at least July 17. Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner responded by saying, “I don’t have much sympathy with this, after an entire region was forced into lockdown, this will not help to lessen the public’s irritation.”</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After containing an outbreak in the North Rhine-Westphalia region, Germany’s reproduction rate of COVID-19 decreased to 0.96 over the past week as a 7-day average. The localized lockdown in the region is still in place. To motivate mask-wearing, Chancellor Angela Merkel and other officials are pointing to the US and the UK as examples of the risks and consequences of lax hygiene practices. The country’s official app for tracking cases has been downloaded by 15 million people (around 18% of the population), more than any other European country. A recent poll showed that around half of Germans are fearful of a second wave, but more people think climate change is a bigger issue for Germany's EU presidency run than the pandemic. Additionally, German military sniffer dogs are being trained to detect COVID-19 in human saliva by the Bundeswehr and the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Germany’s reproduction rate of COVID-19 jumped to 2.88 on June 21, after several outbreaks last week. Since case numbers in Germany are generally low, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the reproduction number. The outbreak at a meatpacking plant in North Rhine-Westphalia (the region most vocal about urging Chancellor Angela Merkel to ease lockdown restrictions) has forced local authorities to reinforce a lockdown. The way that Merkel and local officials handle this outbreak is a test for the federation’s local intervention approach. Accordingly, hundreds of German riot police are deployed to ensure that the 500,000 inhabitants in the regions of Gütersloh and Warendorf are adhering to the rules. With museums, bars, cinemas and gyms closed, people in those regions can now only meet one other person in public. Restaurants have been allowed to remain open, but many have decided to close. Authorities stopped short of ordering a regional quarantine, because the number of new cases remained below the 50 per 100,000 people. However, all employees of the Tönnies plant — many of whom are migrant workers — are under quarantine in their living quarters, with physical metal fencing erected around their residential buildings to prevent them from leaving. Additionally, since its launch a week ago, the Corona-Warn-App has been downloaded by 12.2 million people, or 14% of the population.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, the average reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Germany remained below the 1.0 target. However, on June 17, Germany reported a spike of 1,100 cases due to an outbreak at a Toennies GmbH meatpacking plant in Guetersloh, which accounted for 657 positive cases. The plant was closed, 7,000 people were quarantined, and schools and childcare facilities in the region were ordered to close starting June 19 until June 29, nevertheless there are no plans for a broader lockdown. This is a part of Germany's local intervention strategy, where each municipality/state has the authority to close sectors if there is an outbreak. This outbreak prompted officials to criticize the living conditions of workers in the meatpacking industry, where social distancing is impossible. On June 16, Germany launched its contact tracing app Covid-Warn-App. It is intended to complement, not replace, existing low-tech contact tracing efforts, which rely on calling people who test positive to ask about their movements within the last 48 hours. The launch comes at a time when EU states are discussing guidelines for interoperability to track cases across the EU, with the creation of a central gateway to handle data traffic between the apps based on the Google-Apple standard. While using the software is voluntary, its success depends on how many people download and register with the app. In response to privacy concerns, the app has an added layer of security protecting the identity of the user from other users and from the government.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, the 4-day average reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Germany continues to decrease, standing at 0.86 on June 10, down from 0.89 reported last week. Germany has extended its travel advisory warning for Germans wishing to travel abroad until August 31, and Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is campaigning for the EU-wide travel ban for non-EU citizens to be extended until July 1. On June 11, Germany allowed 243 ill and under-age refugees from Greece to enter the country, for the first time since the pandemic began. Each state continues to open up unilaterally, based on federal suggestions regarding the R-naught variable. Larger stores, markets, malls and restaurants are open across the country. The remaining discrepancies between the states are largely tied to cultural and leisure activities, such as cinemas, museums and fitness centers. Within the next two weeks, these institutions should be more harmonized with their reopening. On June 10, Chancellor Merkel and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang met virtually to discuss the bilateral trade relations between the countries; Germany is advocating for a more liberated trade market with the Asian nation.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, the 4-day average reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Germany decreased to 0.89. Most sectors in Germany have reopened with additional hygiene measures. On June 15, the tourism sector will reopen on allowing European travelers in the country without quarantine. Moreover, it will allow Germans to travel to other countries if the infection rate in destination countries is below 50 per 100,000 people per week. Chancellor Angela Merkel says the governing coalition has agreed on a €130 billion stimulus package to help revive the virus-hit economy. The measures include temporarily cutting value-added taxes from 19% to 16%, providing families with an additional €300 per child and doubling a government-supported rebate on electric car purchases. The package also establishes a €50 billion fund for addressing climate change, innovation and digitization within the German economy. Doctors in Germany are seeing a problematic drop in patients with serious health conditions seeking medical help, for fear of contracting COVID-19 in the clinics. Furthermore, thousands of protestors defied the gatherings ban in Berlin on June 2, after George Floyd's death last week in the US.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Even though Germany has logged less than 500 daily cases for the past week, Chancellor Angela Merkel claims that Germany is still at the beginning of the pandemic. Roughly half of the country's 30,000 ICU beds are vacant, prompting certain states to accept patients from Russia. Many of the country’s shops, museums, bars, and restaurants have reopened, with physical distancing and hygiene guidelines. Cinemas, gyms, pools, and beer gardens have begun opening in certain states. Masks are compulsory on public transport and in shops. Although the federal government had a more unified approach while locking down the economy in March, each state is now adopting unilateral steps to loosen restrictions, creating a patchwork of wildly varying rules on physical distancing within the country. For example, the Premier of Baden-Württemberg announced on May 26th that his state would allow seated public events with up to 100 people from June 1st. Social distancing rules remain in place throughout the federation throughout June. Germany has been praised for its effective contact-tracing strategy, which is low-tech and relies on information given by the COVID positive patient. "Contact-tracers" conduct 15 minute phone calls with recently diagnosed patients, and ask about their movements and close interactions within the last 48 hours. A Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll has found that more than seven out of ten Germans view Merkel's performance positively, with roughly two-thirds agreeing that the health impacts of COVID-19 outweigh the economic impacts. Merkel has the highest approval rating amongst EU leaders. Nevertheless, protests against the sustained lockdown measures continue to take place every Saturday, with thousands protesting last weekend.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite a gradual lift in restrictions, COVID-19 lockdown fatigue is spreading rapidly throughout Germany. On May 16th, more than 10,000  unsatisfied citizens protested against Chancellor Merkel's "Corona Dictatorship," with even larger protests expected this weekend. The Federation's far-right opposition party (AfD) has been mobilizing and capitalizing on these protests. Protestors include anti-vaxxers, neo-Nazis, anti-capitalists, and ordinary citizens concerned about job losses, and safety at reopened nurseries and schools. Restaurants across Germany, including Berlin, are now allowed to receive guests between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. However, in many tourist and financial districts, restaurants remain closed due to the lack of demand. Restaurant clients are encouraged to write down their contact details to allow for contact tracing, and sign a paper saying that they conform to the law, freeing restaurant owners from liability, should the police check. Contact details are then destroyed after four weeks, prompting environmental concerns about paper waste. On May 19th, Germany and France announced a blueprint for a €500 billion recovery fund, which will offer grants to help countries, regions, and sectors within the EU. This is seen as a departure from Merkel's typical frugality regarding grants in lieu of loans, and she will need to lobby her own party to support the fund. Nordic and Eastern European countries have begun criticizing the plan, ahead of planned debates at the European Parliament.</p>
