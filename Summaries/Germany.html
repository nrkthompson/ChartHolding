  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Germany’s reproduction rate of COVID-19 jumped to 2.88 on June 21, after several outbreaks last week. Since case numbers in Germany are generally low, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the reproduction number. The outbreak at a meatpacking plant in North Rhine-Westphalia (the region most vocal about urging Chancellor Angela Merkel to ease lockdown restrictions) has forced local authorities to reinforce a lockdown. The way that Merkel and local officials handle this outbreak is a test for the federation’s local intervention approach. Accordingly, hundreds of German riot police are deployed to ensure that the 500,000 inhabitants in the regions of Gütersloh and Warendorf are adhering to the rules. With museums, bars, cinemas and gyms closed, people in those regions can now only meet one other person in public. Restaurants have been allowed to remain open, but many have decided to close. Authorities stopped short of ordering a regional quarantine, because the number of new cases remained below the 50 per 100,000 people. However, all employees of the Tönnies plant — many of whom are migrant workers — are under quarantine in their living quarters, with physical metal fencing erected around their residential buildings to prevent them from leaving. Additionally, since its launch a week ago, the Corona-Warn-App has been downloaded by 12.2 million people, or 14% of the population.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, the average reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Germany remained below the 1.0 target. However, on June 17, Germany reported a spike of 1,100 cases due to an outbreak at a Toennies GmbH meatpacking plant in Guetersloh, which accounted for 657 positive cases. The plant was closed, 7,000 people were quarantined, and schools and childcare facilities in the region were ordered to close starting June 19 until June 29, nevertheless there are no plans for a broader lockdown. This is a part of Germany's local intervention strategy, where each municipality/state has the authority to close sectors if there is an outbreak. This outbreak prompted officials to criticize the living conditions of workers in the meatpacking industry, where social distancing is impossible. On June 16, Germany launched its contact tracing app Covid-Warn-App. It is intended to complement, not replace, existing low-tech contact tracing efforts, which rely on calling people who test positive to ask about their movements within the last 48 hours. The launch comes at a time when EU states are discussing guidelines for interoperability to track cases across the EU, with the creation of a central gateway to handle data traffic between the apps based on the Google-Apple standard. While using the software is voluntary, its success depends on how many people download and register with the app. In response to privacy concerns, the app has an added layer of security protecting the identity of the user from other users and from the government.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, the 4-day average reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Germany continues to decrease, standing at 0.86 on June 10, down from 0.89 reported last week. Germany has extended its travel advisory warning for Germans wishing to travel abroad until August 31, and Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is campaigning for the EU-wide travel ban for non-EU citizens to be extended until July 1. On June 11, Germany allowed 243 ill and under-age refugees from Greece to enter the country, for the first time since the pandemic began. Each state continues to open up unilaterally, based on federal suggestions regarding the R-naught variable. Larger stores, markets, malls and restaurants are open across the country. The remaining discrepancies between the states are largely tied to cultural and leisure activities, such as cinemas, museums and fitness centers. Within the next two weeks, these institutions should be more harmonized with their reopening. On June 10, Chancellor Merkel and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang met virtually to discuss the bilateral trade relations between the countries; Germany is advocating for a more liberated trade market with the Asian nation.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, the 4-day average reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Germany decreased to 0.89. Most sectors in Germany have reopened with additional hygiene measures. On June 15, the tourism sector will reopen on allowing European travelers in the country without quarantine. Moreover, it will allow Germans to travel to other countries if the infection rate in destination countries is below 50 per 100,000 people per week. Chancellor Angela Merkel says the governing coalition has agreed on a €130 billion stimulus package to help revive the virus-hit economy. The measures include temporarily cutting value-added taxes from 19% to 16%, providing families with an additional €300 per child and doubling a government-supported rebate on electric car purchases. The package also establishes a €50 billion fund for addressing climate change, innovation and digitization within the German economy. Doctors in Germany are seeing a problematic drop in patients with serious health conditions seeking medical help, for fear of contracting COVID-19 in the clinics. Furthermore, thousands of protestors defied the gatherings ban in Berlin on June 2, after George Floyd's death last week in the US.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Even though Germany has logged less than 500 daily cases for the past week, Chancellor Angela Merkel claims that Germany is still at the beginning of the pandemic. Roughly half of the country's 30,000 ICU beds are vacant, prompting certain states to accept patients from Russia. Many of the country’s shops, museums, bars, and restaurants have reopened, with physical distancing and hygiene guidelines. Cinemas, gyms, pools, and beer gardens have begun opening in certain states. Masks are compulsory on public transport and in shops. Although the federal government had a more unified approach while locking down the economy in March, each state is now adopting unilateral steps to loosen restrictions, creating a patchwork of wildly varying rules on physical distancing within the country. For example, the Premier of Baden-Württemberg announced on May 26th that his state would allow seated public events with up to 100 people from June 1st. Social distancing rules remain in place throughout the federation throughout June. Germany has been praised for its effective contact-tracing strategy, which is low-tech and relies on information given by the COVID positive patient. "Contact-tracers" conduct 15 minute phone calls with recently diagnosed patients, and ask about their movements and close interactions within the last 48 hours. A Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll has found that more than seven out of ten Germans view Merkel's performance positively, with roughly two-thirds agreeing that the health impacts of COVID-19 outweigh the economic impacts. Merkel has the highest approval rating amongst EU leaders. Nevertheless, protests against the sustained lockdown measures continue to take place every Saturday, with thousands protesting last weekend.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite a gradual lift in restrictions, COVID-19 lockdown fatigue is spreading rapidly throughout Germany. On May 16th, more than 10,000  unsatisfied citizens protested against Chancellor Merkel's "Corona Dictatorship," with even larger protests expected this weekend. The Federation's far-right opposition party (AfD) has been mobilizing and capitalizing on these protests. Protestors include anti-vaxxers, neo-Nazis, anti-capitalists, and ordinary citizens concerned about job losses, and safety at reopened nurseries and schools. Restaurants across Germany, including Berlin, are now allowed to receive guests between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. However, in many tourist and financial districts, restaurants remain closed due to the lack of demand. Restaurant clients are encouraged to write down their contact details to allow for contact tracing, and sign a paper saying that they conform to the law, freeing restaurant owners from liability, should the police check. Contact details are then destroyed after four weeks, prompting environmental concerns about paper waste. On May 19th, Germany and France announced a blueprint for a €500 billion recovery fund, which will offer grants to help countries, regions, and sectors within the EU. This is seen as a departure from Merkel's typical frugality regarding grants in lieu of loans, and she will need to lobby her own party to support the fund. Nordic and Eastern European countries have begun criticizing the plan, ahead of planned debates at the European Parliament.</p>
