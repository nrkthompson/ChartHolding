      Turkey has been reporting an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases with daily cases spiking as much as 22% in a single day. The sudden increase in new infections came as Turkey launched a normalization process. Beginning June 1, Ankara lifted or significantly eased much of the restrictions on daily life. Weekend curfews and travel restrictions on the country’s worst-hit 15 provinces were lifted, while restaurants, malls and gyms were all permitted to open. On June 9, people over the age of 65 were allowed to go outside between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. A curfew which was declared for the elderly on March 22 was lifted and those younger than 18 were also allowed to go outside if they were with their parents. The government resumed international flights on June 11 and announced that all tourism facilities, theaters and concert halls would reopen as of July 1.172 Armenian churches in Turkey reopened their doors for weddings over the June 13 weekend. Amid strict measures of social distancing and guests wearing masks, the Armenian Patriarchate decided to join the country’s normalization steps starting on June 14 and allowed weddings. The patriarchate announced that the first mass would be held on July 19.173 However, the government announced on June 16, that if the number of daily cases exceeds 2,000, they may have to consider introducing localized, province-specific curfews and reintroduce a ban on parks and picnic areas as well as on events with crowds and also impose fines on those who do not wear face masks, recommendations that all align with those from the Health Ministry’s Science Board.174
