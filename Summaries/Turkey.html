      Turkey has been reporting an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases with daily cases spiking as much as 22% in a single day. The sudden increase in new infections came as Turkey launched a normalization process. Beginning June 1, Ankara lifted or significantly eased much of the restrictions on daily life. Weekend curfews and travel restrictions on the country’s worst-hit 15 provinces were lifted, while restaurants, malls and gyms were all permitted to open. On June 9, people over the age of 65 were allowed to go outside between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. A curfew which was declared for the elderly on March 22 was lifted and those younger than 18 were also allowed to go outside if they were with their parents. The government resumed international flights on June 11 and announced that all tourism facilities, theaters and concert halls would reopen as of July 1. Armenian churches in Turkey reopened their doors for weddings over the June 13 weekend. Amid strict measures of social distancing and guests wearing masks, the Armenian Patriarchate decided to join the country’s normalization steps starting on June 14 and allowed weddings. The patriarchate announced that the first mass would be held on July 19. However, the government announced on June 16, that if the number of daily cases exceeds 2,000, they may have to consider introducing localized, province-specific curfews and reintroduce a ban on parks and picnic areas as well as on events with crowds and also impose fines on those who do not wear face masks, recommendations that all align with those from the Health Ministry’s Science Board.

      After suspending all international flights on March 28, amid COVID-19-related travel restrictions worldwide, Turkey announced the resumption of international flights to 40 countries on June 10. The resumption of flights began with flights to the Netherlands, Germany and London on June 11 and will be followed by flights to Belgium and France on June 15, and later Austria on June 16. Resumption of  domestic flights began on June 1. Passenger entry into the terminals is regulated with temperature checks at the entrance and only allows passengers with valid tickets to enter. Social distancing is required for passengers and airport personnel. After a week of easing lockdown measures, there was a surge of COVID-19 cases in Diyarbak?r, one of the biggest cities in Turkey’s southeast region, so the  health authorities increased the number of COVID-19 clinics in the city from one to five and launched two pandemic hospitals. Diyarbak?r’s Governor  announced on June 8, that the city’s residents must wear masks in public effective June 10. He lamented that the city was not at the desired level of mask use or social distancing which contributed to an increase in the number of positive cases. Several neighborhoods and districts in the city are already under lockdown after a large number of cases emerged this week.

      With a drop in new cases as of May 29, Turkey declared the outbreak to be under control and  launched a process of “normalization,” effective June 1, under which almost all restrictions in the country were lifted, including restrictions on inter-city travel and domestic flights. However, citizens aged 65 and older and minors are still requested to stay home and require special permits to travel, since these groups are the most at-risk. Inter-city buses are allowed to operate at half capacity under COVID-19 measures. The national carrier Turkish Airlines (THY) launched the first domestic flight between Istanbul and Ankara with additional flights to other cities scheduled as of June 3. Passengers are required to receive a code from the Health Ministry which confirms their health condition before boarding flights. With the exception of  laptops, purses and baby strollers, all other hand baggage is banned on flights and masks are mandatory. Using thermal cameras, passengers are screened for body temperature at airport entrances. The ticket checking procedure will now be conducted automatically by devices installed at the airport. Hotels, beaches and historic sites in popular tourist destinations reopened with preventative measures. Restaurants and cafes fully reopened with the exception of bars, nightclubs and hookah lounges, which remain closed. Eatery staff are supposed to distribute kolonya and sanitizers to customers and check their body temperature and use of masks prior to admission. Tables must also be disinfected before new customers book the table. Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar, museums, gyms, sports facilities, child care centers and nurseries also reopened with strict health measures. Barbers, beauty salons, shopping malls and mosques now operate at full capacity.

      Intercity trains resumed operations on May 28, with tickets being sold at half their original price through ticket offices, websites and mobile applications. Trains are scheduled to make 16 trips daily, with passengers maintaining physical distancing guidelines. Friday prayers are expected to resume by May 29 with strict hygienic measures in place - such as requiring ritual ablution to be performed at home, the use of masks, and personal prayer rugs recommended at mosques. The world-famous Konyaalt? beach in Turkey is also all set to reopen by June 1 with strict hygienic and social distancing rules in place. Beachgoers will no longer be allowed to lay their towels indiscriminately on the sand to sunbathe; instead, warning signs will be placed with 9m of designated space between each beachgoer to prevent crowding and close proximity among tourists. Beachgoers will have to wait until 20 minutes after the previous user has left before claiming a beach area. Social distancing lanes will be placed in areas with changing cabins and showers. The reopening of beaches comes after the announcement of the “healthy tourism certificate” programme, set to launch by June 1st, with an aim to  convince travellers that it is safe to visit Turkey’s beaches and historic treasures this year. This certificate sets criteria for health and hygiene in airlines, airports and other transport, as well as hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes, and will be awarded by international institutions, and the information be sent to tour operators.
