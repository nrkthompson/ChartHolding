  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Turkey announced strict new measures to fight COVID-19 infections on September 7, as the daily infection numbers in the country crossed the 1,000-mark. In all provinces, passengers cannot stand on public transport, and cafes and restaurants will be subject to stricter inspections. The government does not plan to reintroduce a full lockdown but has urged Turks to follow social distancing and hygiene measures. Food and entertainment establishments have also been prohibited from having live or recorded music after midnight. On September 8, Turkey announced that it is scaling back plans to reopen schools later in September, with only the youngest pupils beginning classes at first for up to two days a week. Both in person and remote learning are encouraged. Effective September 8, Turkey also mandated the wearing of masks in all public areas including streets, parks, gardens, picnic areas, beaches, public transportation vehicles, workplaces and factories.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Figures released by Turkey’s Health Ministry show that COVID-19 infections are rising slowly but steadily. However, Turkey’s largest medical association says that the country’s actual number of COVID-19 cases is much higher than in reported figures. Turkey has decided to report only cases of COVID-19 that are confirmed with a PCR test, which goes against World Health Organization guidelines.  One Turkish ICU doctor reported that even some patients who test positive for COVID-19 and receive treatment may not be included in the official tally. Following the recommendations of the health officials, local authorities across the country have recently adopted a series of new measures for those over 65 years old, the most significant risk group. The elderly in over 20 provinces, including the capital Ankara, are now prohibited from using public transportation during rush hour, as well as prohibited from entering crowded locations at certain hours of the day. The Interior Ministry has launched its seventh comprehensive inspections since May to monitor compliance with COVID-19 rules across the country. Inspections have been carried out in markets, workplaces, groceries, bazaars, public transport vehicles, restaurants, cafeterias, and taxis.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Turkey plans to reopen schools on September 21 with measures in place to counter COVID-19. Education will resume in the distance learning program on August 31, with a gradual return to classrooms by September. Private schools may start online classes on August 17. Classrooms will be arranged in accordance with social distancing rules and schools will be provided with disinfectants and masks. Measures will be taken if students’ families or nearby circles are diagnosed with COVID-19. Over 2,000 inspectors have been checking the standards of schools ahead of the planned reopening. Even though the COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate has been declining, severe infection care is rising in Turkey. The number of seriously ill people continues to rise--with most of the new cases recorded in Istanbul, the Central Anatolian province of Konya, and the southeastern provinces of Diyarbak?r and ?anl?urfa. Officials earlier this week suggested that the government may consider introducing stricter measures in September to curb the spread of the virus as daily new infections have spiked above 1,000. Authorities suggested that restrictions like the ones introduced in April may be reimposed starting mid-September.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A surge in COVID-19 cases has prompted the Turkish government to debate new restrictions, including changes to the school calendar. Since the Muslim holiday of Eid al Adha earlier in August, the outbreak has spread fast in major cities including Ankara, Konya, Sanliurfa and Bursa, according to Health Ministry data. Over the past few weeks, health authorities have warned citizens to be very careful about the threat. As of August 3, daily new cases have surpassed 1,000 for the first time in about a month. School reopenings, currently scheduled for August 31, may now vary by province--with some provinces cancelling their school reopening plan for the current academic year. In the Central Anatolian province of Konya, authorities have scrapped a plan to open private schools on Aug. 15.  Among the options being discussed are online lessons, a full opening or a hybrid. While ruling out city-wide curfews, the government is discussing restrictions on movement or limiting social interaction in certain districts. The Health Ministry has strongly urged provincial governors to exercise their authority. Turkey’s interior ministry announced new measures on August 6, with “one-on-one monitoring” for people who have been required to self-quarantine--especially in the first seven days of isolation. The ministry warned it would not accept any violations of mandatory mask rules, as well as the requirement to maintain social distancing in gatherings such as weddings or circumcision ceremonies.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 1, the Turkish state announced their decision to provide more financial support to over one  million families during the COVID-19 outbreak. The government launched the Social Protection Shield program in March to meet citizens’ needs during the pandemic. Over 2 billion liras (over $286 USD million) have been distributed to citizens so far, with at least 1.2 million families each having received 1,000 Turkish liras ($143 USD) in financial support. On August 1, Iraq suspended all flights to Turkey--citing the recent rise of COVID-19 infections in the country.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After 86 years of operating as a museum, the Hagia Sophia reopened its doors on July 24 as a mosque, with strict social distancing measures in place. Temperature checks on arrival and the use of face masks are mandatory at all times. After the number of infections remained stable throughout July (less than 1,000 cases reported a day), the government relaxed restrictions on the working hours of eateries on July 21 -- allowing them to remain open until midnight. Businesses in 81 provinces were allowed to return to normal operations. Face mask requirements, social distancing regulations, and weekend restrictions on inter-city travel remain in place. Security forces are required to conduct routine inspections in crowded areas and issue warnings to those without masks.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 19, the Turkish Health Minister reported that Turkey had stabilized after a struggle with an increasing number of new cases associated with its reopening. Numerous cases have been linked to a lack of compliance with mandatory mask and social distancing policies. Security forces have also been advised to conduct routine inspections in crowded areas and issue warnings to those without masks. They may impose fines. In an announcement made on July 17, the PM ruled out a curfew for Qurban Bayram, a 3-day religious event celebrated in the Muslim world—in contrast to the curfew that was imposed on the previous religious celebration that took place in May. Experts pointed out the high risk of infection at crowded public spaces, though a number of safety measures have been put in place. Turkey suspended all flights to Iran and Afghanistan on July 18 due to an increasing infection and mortality rate in Iran. Cargo flights are exempted from this suspension.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 10, the Prime Minister of Turkey announced that the Hagia Sophia would reopen as a mosque for worshippers on July 24. The building had previously housed a museum for many decades. The Prime Minister stated that the building will continue to be open to all, as is the case with all other mosques. On July 11, Turkey’s Health Ministry released an updated list of guidelines for barbershops and hair salons. Cell phones may not be used while serving customers, and the number of visitors inside the shop is limited. Handshakes are completely forbidden. Staff and customers are not supposed to talk at all, but if they do speak, they must do so quietly in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 lingering in the air. To avoid crowding in salons and shops, customers must make an appointment, while children and other companions are strictly not allowed.  Barbershops and beauty salons were among the first businesses to open in early May as Turkey gradually emerged out of stay-at-home orders and weekend lockdowns.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After entering the normalization phase on June 1, the health ministry released a 28-day detailed COVID-19 report on June 28.  The report highlighted an increase in the number of new cases occurring in Istanbul. Men make up the majority of the cases and fatalities across the country. Turkey was excluded from the EU’s “safe country” travel list on June 30. However, Turkey was included in the 59 countries that are exempted from the 14-day quarantine requirement upon travel to England effective July 10. A special center for conducting COVID-19 tests was established at the Istanbul airport on July 2; tests will be processed in the labs located at the airport terminal. Results are delivered within two hours in both Turkish and English. The center has the capacity to conduct 38,000 to 40,000 tests per day. On July 3, Turkey also announced plans to carry out high-level visits to several countries with the aim of explaining the health and safety measures it took to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and enable foreign tourists to experience a safe vacation. Schools are scheduled to reopen by the end of August under strict rules laid out in a guide released by the country’s Health Ministry on July 6.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 24, Turkey has witnessed a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases. This follows the government’s decision to authorize cafes, restaurants, gyms, parks, beaches and museums to reopen completely and their decision to ease stay-at-home orders for the elderly and young people at the beginning of June. Despite registering a rise in average daily infection cases in June, Turkey isn’t considering tightening its lockdown restrictions any further. In fact, on June 24, the Turkish culture and tourism minister announced new measures in the tourism sector to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The minister revealed that more than 727 hotels and 900 restaurants have applied for the "Safe Tourism Certificate," which would prove that they have standard precautionary health measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus. Officials disguised as "hidden guests" will also be sent to inspect hotels and restaurants on a regular basis. On June 24, Turkey reopened its mosques for prayers with congregation, and directed worshippers to wear masks and maintain social distancing. Turkey has informed other countries about their current health infrastructure to reassure them that Turkey is safe for tourism. COVID-19 testing centers are scheduled to be set up at all Turkish international airports by July 1.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Turkey has been reporting an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases with daily cases spiking as much as 22% in a single day. The sudden increase in new infections came as Turkey launched a normalization process. Beginning June 1, Ankara lifted or significantly eased much of the restrictions on daily life. Weekend curfews and travel restrictions on the country’s worst-hit 15 provinces were lifted, while restaurants, malls and gyms were all permitted to open. On June 9, people over the age of 65 were allowed to go outside between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. A curfew which was declared for the elderly on March 22 was lifted and those younger than 18 were also allowed to go outside if they were with their parents. The government resumed international flights on June 11 and announced that all tourism facilities, theaters and concert halls would reopen as of July 1. Armenian churches in Turkey reopened their doors for weddings over the June 13 weekend. Amid strict measures of social distancing and guests wearing masks, the Armenian Patriarchate decided to join the country’s normalization steps starting on June 14 and allowed weddings. The patriarchate announced that the first mass would be held on July 19. However, the government announced on June 16, that if the number of daily cases exceeds 2,000, they may have to consider introducing localized, province-specific curfews and reintroduce a ban on parks and picnic areas as well as on events with crowds and also impose fines on those who do not wear face masks, recommendations that all align with those from the Health Ministry’s Science Board.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After suspending all international flights on March 28, amid COVID-19-related travel restrictions worldwide, Turkey announced the resumption of international flights to 40 countries on June 10. The resumption of flights began with flights to the Netherlands, Germany and London on June 11 and will be followed by flights to Belgium and France on June 15, and later Austria on June 16. Resumption of  domestic flights began on June 1. Passenger entry into the terminals is regulated with temperature checks at the entrance and only allows passengers with valid tickets to enter. Social distancing is required for passengers and airport personnel. After a week of easing lockdown measures, there was a surge of COVID-19 cases in Diyarbak?r, one of the biggest cities in Turkey’s southeast region, so the  health authorities increased the number of COVID-19 clinics in the city from one to five and launched two pandemic hospitals. Diyarbak?r’s Governor  announced on June 8, that the city’s residents must wear masks in public effective June 10. He lamented that the city was not at the desired level of mask use or social distancing which contributed to an increase in the number of positive cases. Several neighborhoods and districts in the city are already under lockdown after a large number of cases emerged this week.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With a drop in new cases as of May 29, Turkey declared the outbreak to be under control and  launched a process of “normalization,” effective June 1, under which almost all restrictions in the country were lifted, including restrictions on inter-city travel and domestic flights. However, citizens aged 65 and older and minors are still requested to stay home and require special permits to travel, since these groups are the most at-risk. Inter-city buses are allowed to operate at half capacity under COVID-19 measures. The national carrier Turkish Airlines (THY) launched the first domestic flight between Istanbul and Ankara with additional flights to other cities scheduled as of June 3. Passengers are required to receive a code from the Health Ministry which confirms their health condition before boarding flights. With the exception of  laptops, purses and baby strollers, all other hand baggage is banned on flights and masks are mandatory. Using thermal cameras, passengers are screened for body temperature at airport entrances. The ticket checking procedure will now be conducted automatically by devices installed at the airport. Hotels, beaches and historic sites in popular tourist destinations reopened with preventative measures. Restaurants and cafes fully reopened with the exception of bars, nightclubs and hookah lounges, which remain closed. Eatery staff are supposed to distribute kolonya and sanitizers to customers and check their body temperature and use of masks prior to admission. Tables must also be disinfected before new customers book the table. Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar, museums, gyms, sports facilities, child care centers and nurseries also reopened with strict health measures. Barbers, beauty salons, shopping malls and mosques now operate at full capacity.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Intercity trains resumed operations on May 28, with tickets being sold at half their original price through ticket offices, websites and mobile applications. Trains are scheduled to make 16 trips daily, with passengers maintaining physical distancing guidelines. Friday prayers are expected to resume by May 29 with strict hygienic measures in place - such as requiring ritual ablution to be performed at home, the use of masks, and personal prayer rugs recommended at mosques. The world-famous Konyaalt? beach in Turkey is also all set to reopen by June 1 with strict hygienic and social distancing rules in place. Beachgoers will no longer be allowed to lay their towels indiscriminately on the sand to sunbathe; instead, warning signs will be placed with 9m of designated space between each beachgoer to prevent crowding and close proximity among tourists. Beachgoers will have to wait until 20 minutes after the previous user has left before claiming a beach area. Social distancing lanes will be placed in areas with changing cabins and showers. The reopening of beaches comes after the announcement of the “healthy tourism certificate” programme, set to launch by June 1st, with an aim to  convince travellers that it is safe to visit Turkey’s beaches and historic treasures this year. This certificate sets criteria for health and hygiene in airlines, airports and other transport, as well as hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes, and will be awarded by international institutions, and the information be sent to tour operators.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 18, the Turkish government announced a 4 day curfew in all 81 provinces during Ramadan Feast - effective May 23 to May 26 - in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Mosques across the country will gradually reopen starting on May 29, with noon and afternoon prayers expected to resume shortly after. Effective May 24, senior citizens aged 65 and above will be allowed to leave their homes between the hours of  14:00 and 20:00. Kindergartens and daycare centers are scheduled to reopen by June 15, while high schools and universities are to remain closed until the beginning of the new academic year in September. Visiting hours in prisons - which have been prohibited since the beginning of the pandemic - will also in June, with a leave extension of two months provided to over 60 thousand convicts in open prisons. On May 19, the government also announced an official extension of its travel ban for another 15 days in 15 major cities, effective May 20 to June 3. Air, land, and sea travel to and from Istanbul, Ankara, ?zmir, Bal?kesir, Bursa, Eskisehir, Gaziantep, Kayseri, Kocaeli, Konya, Manisa, Sakarya, Samsun, Van, and Zonguldak will be restricted.</p>
