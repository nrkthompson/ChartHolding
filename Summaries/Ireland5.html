      On June 15, all shopping centres reopened with strict social distancing measures in place, including the closure of dining and seating areas around the stores to lessen dwell time among shoppers and discourage browsing for longer periods of time. To enforce social distancing with the stores, only a certain number of customers are allowed inside. Visits to nursing homes and residential care facilities are also allowed with pre-reservations of half an hour and a compulsory application of mask and gloves. Despite masks not deemed mandatory, people have been advised to wear them on public transport, in enclosed spaces and when visiting older people. Creches, pre-schools, hotels, restaurants and bars which provide table service, are scheduled to reopen within phase three of the relaxation strategy, effective June 29.
