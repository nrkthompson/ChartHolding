  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 8, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported the state’s highest single-day increase in COVID-19 cases in more than two months: 2,190 cases. With cases increasing across the state, Governor J.B. Pritzker announced new rules and fines on Friday for businesses and schools that repeatedly ignore COVID-19 restrictions and mask requirements. Pritzker emphasized that state authorities will focus enforcement on businesses that don’t comply with the rules, not individuals. Springfield Public Schools established a remote learning dress code, forbidding students from wearing pajama pants, slippers or hats while on camera.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Eleven Illinois counties are now in the “warning” level, signalling that COVID metrics in these counties are not safe. Chicago continues to enforce a quarantine on out-of-state travellers from states where the case rate is greater than 15 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 resident population, per day, over a 7-day rolling average.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">More than 28,000 people in Illinois have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in July to date, surpassing the June total (23,000). Almost half of this month's new cases were confirmed this past week. Three counties were issued "warnings" for exceeding their limits on covid-related public health metrics. Governor J.B Pritzker has revised Illinois' reopening strategy by introducing a localized lockdown measure that groups counties into 11 different regions, based largely on shared hospital resources. Chicago has its own region.  No regions have been locked down yet.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinois is experiencing a resurgence: its daily COVID-19 case count exceeded 1,000 for four days last week—the longest stretch of four-digit daily caseloads since a peak in May. The virus has infected a rising number of people 18 to 29 years old in recent weeks, many of whom were likely going to bars and acting unsafely. Although some counties have entered the “warning” designation regarding COVID metrics (e.g. test positivity rate), Governor J.B. Pritzker has yet to announce any rollbacks in terms of the state’s reopening plan.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This weekend, the number of confirmed cases in Illinois increased by 1,000 each day, raising concerns about the state's reopening strategy. However, most counties were below the benchmarks for re-closing in most risk metrics. These include: under 50 new cases per 100,000 people per week, decreasing deaths and ICU admissions, and under 10% positivity rate for tests per week. Even though wearing face masks is mandatory, some health experts are calling on Governor JB Pritzker to re-close indoor dining at bars and restaurants, which can be fertile ground for transmission. The Illinois State Department of Education issued a 60-page document this week with guidelines that schools can follow to reopen safely, offering three scenarios: fully onsite, fully remote, and a mixture of the two. Depending on the situation, it is possible that schools would move between these three scenarios, even during the school year.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 26 Illinois entered its fourth phase of reopening. The state reported its lowest death rates since March. After one week of advancing to phase four, all counties in the state, including Chicago, are below the targets of having less than 50 per 100,000 new cases per week and a daily test positivity rate of less than or equal to 10%. Chicago has issued an emergency order requiring travellers who have been to states experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases to self-isolate for two weeks upon return to the city. In this phase of the reopening plan, movie theaters, zoos, museums and health and fitness centers can reopen with limited capacity (ranging from 25% to 50%). Most notably, indoor gatherings of up to 50 people will be permitted, and restaurants will be able to offer indoor dining. Schools and child care programs with social distancing policies in place (maximum 15 children per group) can also reopen, and hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans can return to work in offices at 50% capacity.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Governor JB Pritzker announced that every region in the state will move to phase 4 of their reopening plan on June 26. As the state prepares to reopen further, the government released a map aimed at telling people if their county is more at-risk for COVID-19; only one county is in the "warning" level, with more than 50 cases per 100,000 people weekly. Phase 4 allows movie theaters, zoos, museums and health and fitness centers to reopen with limited capacity (ranging from 25% to 50% capacity). Restaurants will be able to offer indoor dining, and gatherings of up to 50 people will be permitted. Schools and child care programs with social distancing policies in place (15 children per group max) can also reopen and hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans can return to work. The governor stated that he would not hesitate to revert to phase 3 if cases surge.</p>
