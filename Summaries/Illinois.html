  <h5>February 22, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinois reported about 96 new cases of COVID-19 per 100 thousand people last week. The seven-day positivity rate of testing has stayed below 3% for an entire week, the first time in seven months. All 11 regions of Illinois remain in Phase 4 of the stateÕs reopening plan, which is expected to remain in place for some time. Chicago and suburban Cook County have again increased indoor dining capacity at restaurants and bars from 35% to 40%, while still subject to the same upper limit of 50 people. The state is still in Phase 1B of its rollout plan. Heavy snow, together with delayed shipments from the federal government, has led to a drop in vaccine distribution and administration. More than 2 million Illinois residents have been vaccinated against COVID-19 so far.</p> 
  <h5>February 15, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinois reported about 125 new cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people last week. On February 13, the state’s seven-day positivity rate of testing fell below 3%. Illinois reported its first case of the South African variant on February 11. All 11 regions of Illinois remain in Phase 4 of the state’s reopening plan. The state health departments will begin to receive a larger amount of COVID-19 vaccine second doses starting this week. But there will be fewer first doses due to the limitation of federal shipments. Beginning February 25, Illinois residents aged 16 or older with underlying health conditions or disabilities will be eligible to receive the vaccination, a change that nearly doubles the size of the eligible population.</p> 
  <h5>February 8, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinois reported about 158 new cases of COVID-19 per 100 thousand people last week. As of February 8, all 11 regions of Illinois are in Phase 4 of the state’s reopening plan. The mayor of Chicago and the Chicago Teachers Union have reached a tentative agreement to reopen city schools for families seeking in-person instruction, narrowly averting a strike. Under the tentative framework, the first group of students and staff, pre-K and special education cluster programs, would return on February 11. Illinois is slowly catching up with its mass vaccination program; the state’s rolling average of doses administered per day is approaching 50,000. State legislators have now been added to the list of those eligible for Phase 1b vaccination.</p> 
  <h5>February 1, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinois reported about 193 new cases of COVID-19 per 100 thousand people in the last week, with a 3.89% positivity rate of testing. Different regions of the state are moving towards further reopening at varied paces. As of February 1, Regions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11 are in Phase 4, while Regions 8, 9 and 10 are in Tier 1 mitigations, and Region 4 is in Tier 2. Chicago, Region 11, moved to Phase 4 on January 31, even as restrictions on indoor dining remain in place. Indoor dining and events are limited to 25% capacity or 25 people per space; establishments must stop serving alcohol at 11 pm and close for in-person service at midnight; capacity caps for most other industries will remain at 40% or 50 people -- whichever is less. Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Teachers Union were unable to reach an agreement over the weekend and public schools in the city have delayed the return of students to in-person classrooms until February 2. To boost ongoing vaccination efforts, state officials have announced that dentists will now be able to volunteer to administer shots at vaccination sites.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The seven-day positivity rate in Illinois dropped to 4.8% as of January 24. Different regions of the state are moving towards further reopening at varied paces. As of January 25, Regions 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 have moved to Phase 4, while Regions 7, 10 and 11 are facing Tier 1 mitigations and Regions 4, 8 and 9 are in Tier 2. Phase 4 is less restrictive and provides the basic requirements for all regions to follow: meetings and social events are limited to a maximum of 50 people or 50% room capacity, whichever is lower; restaurants and bars can resume indoor services for groups of up to 10 people; museums and zoos can open at 25% capacity; seated theater, cinemas and performing arts centers are capped at 50% capacity indoors (up to 50 people) and 20% outdoors; select indoor recreation facilities can reopen while outdoor recreation allows for group sizes of up to 50; retail, personal care, and health and fitness venues should not exceed 50% capacity; and working from home is encouraged. Tier 1 faces additional restrictions in terms of hospitality establishments, meetings and gatherings; Tier 2 adds even more restrictiveness based on Tier 1.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The epidemiological situation in Illinois seems to be improving, and the seven-day positivity rate on all tests dropped to 6.1% as of January 18. The first case of the more contagious UK variant in Illinois was identified on January 15. Due to continued declines in key metrics, including positivity rates and hospitalizations, Regions 2 and 5 were moved to Tier 1 mitigations last week and Region 1 was moved to Tier 2. The other 8 regions will remain in Tier 3. Tier 2 allows casinos, cultural institutions, indoor fitness classes, organized group recreational activities and offices to reopen subject to public health rules. Tier 1 enables further reopening and indoor service is permitted at restaurants. Starting January 25, the state is entering Phase 1B of its vaccination plan, which centers on residents aged 65 years and older and frontline essential workers.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ seven-day statewide test positivity from December 13 to December 19 has decreased since last week, and is now at 9.6%. On December 19, 79 deaths related to COVID-19 were reported -- the first time since early December that the death toll fell below 100 per day. For the last two months, health officials said that the highest number of cases has been people ages 20 to 29 years old. Similar to Thanksgiving, the government is recommending that residents only celebrate Christmas and New Year with those in their household. Now that the first vaccines have been administered in the state, the governor reiterated that returning to normal -- or ÒPhase 5Ó under his governmentÕs plan -- is still months away.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ seven-day statewide test positivity from December 6 to December 12 has decreased from last week, and is now at 10.6%. The 196 fatalities reported on December 10 bring the statewide death toll to 13,861. Statewide restrictions -- including closure of all cultural institutions (including museums, casinos and zoos), banning indoor gatherings, encouraging teleworking if possible, and grocery stores at 50% capacity -- remain in place. Several Illinois healthcare regions that had seen progress in their coronavirus metrics in recent days have taken steps back, but a few are still advancing toward a potential rollback of Tier 3 coronavirus mitigation rules. The governor has indicated that the state may not allow regions to roll back mitigations due to concerns of holiday-related spikes in COVID-19 numbers. Region 6 in east-central Illinois has met all three criteria to move forward, leaving the state to make a decision on whether to pull back on restrictions.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ seven-day statewide test positivity from November 29 to December 5 was 11.8%. Currently, 5,160 people in Illinois are reported to be hospitalized with COVID-19. Of those, 1,103 patients are in the ICU and 643 are on ventilators. Deaths have exponentially increased as Illinois moved past a total of 13,000 COVID-19 deaths on December 5 -- just eight days after marking 12,000 deaths. Funeral homes are reaching capacity. Statewide restrictions -- including closure of all cultural institutions (such as museums, casinos and zoos), banning indoor gatherings, teleworking if possible, and grocery stores at 50% capacity -- remain in place. Illinois plans to distribute its initial allocation of roughly 109,000 doses of a new COVID-19 vaccine to the 50 counties across the state with the highest death rates from the virus.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ seven-day statewide test positivity from November 22 to 28 was 12.1%. Currently, 5,858 people in Illinois are hospitalized with COVID-19. Of those, 1,185 patients are in the ICU with COVID-19 and 723 patients with COVID-19 are on ventilators. The governor is urging everyone to stay home as much as possible to save lives. New restrictions were introduced on November 21 and will remain in place for at least eight more days but will likely last longer. These statewide restrictions include the closure of all cultural institutions (including museums, casinos and zoos), banning indoor gatherings, teleworking if possible, and grocery stores at 50% capacity. Schools remain open.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although IllinoisÕ seven-day average test positivity rate slightly decreased, to 11.5%, on November 21, the state has had its deadliest week in months. The Illinois Department of Public Health reported on average more than 100 COVID-19 deaths per day this week. With over 6,000 hospitalized, the death rate is expected to increase. The state is urging everyone to stay home as much as possible to save lives. New restrictions were introduced on November 21 and will remain in place for at least 14 days, but will likely last longer. These statewide restrictions include the closure of all cultural institutions (including museums, casinos and zoos), banning indoor gatherings, telework where possible, and restricting grocery stores to 50% capacity. Schools remain open.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ seven-day average test positivity rate reached 12.8% on November 15, up from 8% at the start of the month. With a daily average of 12,000 new daily cases across the state, the Mayor of Chicago said that 1 in 18 Chicagoans have active COVID-19 infections as of November 13. Over the next 30 days, those who live in the Chicagoland area are urged to go out only when necessary, which includes leaving for work, school, medical appointments, groceries, take-out food and pharmaceuticals. ThereÕs also a mandatory 10-person cap on social gatherings. Last week, the governor warned that another mandatory stay-at-home order for the whole state could be on its way if the epidemiological situation worsens.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ seven-day average testing positivity rate, the metric experts use to gauge how rapidly the virus is spreading, soared to 10.6% on November 8 -- up from 8% one week ago. Illinois is averaging about 9,710 new infections each day this month, up sharply from OctoberÕs average of 3,777 cases per day. Each of the stateÕs 11 regions is now operating under tightened restrictions, including a suspension of indoor service at bars and restaurants. According to the governor, the pace of testing is not catching up with how quickly the virus is spreading.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 1, Illinois confirmed 6,980 new cases of COVID-19 and reported a statewide positivity rate of 8%. This percentage is the standard that the government is using to enforce resurgence mitigation, which includes a ban on indoor dining and drinking at restaurants and bars in various regions. Consequently, all regions in the Illinois reopening plan, including Chicago, will be under these tighter restrictions by November 4. Despite the rising metrics, many suburbs and restaurants are pushing back on the governorÕs new COVID-19 mitigation restrictions, with some even taking legal action Ñ arguing that the restaurant industry is one of the most regulated and safe industries.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ test positivity rate continues to increase, rising to 6.1% on October 24. This increase is accompanied by record numbers of daily cases this past week. The metro-east region has hit a seven-day rolling average positivity rate of more than 8% for three days in a row, meaning that the region will undergo Òresurgence mitigations,Ó which include a ban on indoor dining and drinking at restaurants and bars. This region underwent mitigations in September, had them lifted in the beginning of October, and will now undergo the mitigations again. Chicago, or Region 11, is still reporting a positivity rate below 8%, at 6.7%; ICU bed availability sits at 25% according to the IDPH.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ test positivity rate continues to increase, rising to 5.2% on October 18. Illinois confirmed the most cases recorded in a single day with over 4,500 people testing positive on October 16. Outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools, workplaces and other facilities are driving a surge of new cases. IllinoisÕ government scales back reopening when a region reaches or surpasses the state-set threshold of 8% positivity rate for three consecutive days. Chicago reported a positivity rate below 8%, at 5.3%.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ test positivity rate, the metric that experts use to gauge how rapidly the virus is spreading, rose to 4.3% on October 12, as the state reports between 2,700 and 3,000 new cases daily. IllinoisÕ government scales back reopening when a region reaches or surpasses the state-set threshold of an 8% positivity rate for three consecutive days. Chicago continues to fare well, reporting a positivity rate comparable to the state average. On October 9, Region 4 began to ease mitigation measures due to a positivity rate lower than 8%, allowing the region to return to Phase 4, just like the rest of the state. Region 1 remains under restrictions.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 3, Illinois surpassed 300,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The stateÕs test positivity rate, the metric that experts use to gauge how rapidly the virus is spreading, is lower than last weekÕs 3.7% at 3.3%. The government scales back reopening when a region reaches or surpasses the state-set threshold of 8% positivity rate for three consecutive days. Accordingly, on September 29, the Governor of Illinois announced that Region 1 would close again due to the rising positivity rates in northwestern Illinois. New restrictions were imposed, including closing indoor bar and restaurant service. Lawmakers in the region responded negatively by claiming that Òthe positivity rate is only one piece of the puzzle,Ó and that ÒRegion 1 has not reached warning levels on hospital bed and ICU utilization.Ó ChicagoÕs mayor announced on September 28 a plan to ease restrictions put in place, allowing indoor bar service to resume, increasing indoor capacity at restaurants, health and fitness centers, personal services, non-essential retail and all other establishments from 25% to 40%.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">IllinoisÕ test positivity rate - the metric that experts use to gauge how rapidly the virus is spreading - is still in an acceptable range at 3.7%. As of September 27, 17 counties were at a "warning level." Although southwestern Illinois is on the way to lift mitigation restrictions (if the region reaches a 6.5% positivity rate), northwestern IllinoisÕ (including Chicago) positivity rate is climbing at a concerning rate. IllinoisÕ government scales back reopening when a region reaches or surpasses the state-set threshold of 8% positivity rate for three consecutive days.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinois’ test positivity rate -- the metric that experts use to gauge how rapidly the virus is spreading -- is at 3.5%, the lowest since July. Although between 1,500 and 2,000 new cases have been added per day this month, positivity rates have decreased across most of the state thanks to booming testing capacity. Last week, 30 counties were at a "warning level." This week, the number fell to 24. Following a high positivity rate in Regions 4 and 7 in August, indoor dining and bars were closed. As of September 20, Region 7 returned to Phase 4 guidelines and Region 4 is on track to return to Phase 4 by the end of the week. Both regions previously struggled with positivity rates higher than 8%, but the automatic mitigation mechanism and increased testing capacity proved to be successful in lowering the rate.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 9, almost a third of Illinois’ counties are considered at a warning level for COVID-19. The positivity rate for COVID-19 testing surged past the state-imposed 8% benchmark in these counties, which automatically activated mitigation measures. Most of the new mitigation measures focus on restaurants and bars, including a ban on indoor seating, capacity limits and earlier closing times among others. The measures will be reviewed again on September 15. Regarding schooling, some districts have opted to return to online learning as the case numbers increase. However, the state has not mandated any closures yet.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 21, Illinois health officials said that 20 out of 102 counties were now considered at a warning level for COVID-19--with cases of the virus connected to schools being reported. Contact tracing data shows the spikes being fueled by people congregating at weddings, businesses, neighborhood gatherings, parties, bars, and travelling to other states and sports camps. Movie theatres across the state reopened on August 22, as part of Phase 4 of the Restore Illinois plan. Theaters are allowed to host audiences of up to 50 people per auditorium or 50% of normal capacity, whichever is less.  Moviegoers are required to wear masks unless they’re eating popcorn or drinking soda.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">For the last three days in a row, Region 4 (Southern Illinois) has reported three consecutive days of positivity rates above 8%, automatically triggering the new restrictions under the state’s regional mitigation plan. The new restrictions include the closure of bars, restaurants and casinos in the region by 11 pm, the closure of all party buses, and a reduction in indoor gathering sizes to 25 people or 25 percent of room capacity--whichever is lower. These restrictions will remain in effect for 14 days, and if numbers don’t begin to improve, more measures--including the total closure of indoor bars and dining--could be implemented. Some school boards have joined a growing list of districts across the state that have cancelled plans for in-person learning in September.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 8, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported the state’s highest single-day increase in COVID-19 cases in more than two months: 2,190 cases. With cases increasing across the state, Governor J.B. Pritzker announced new rules and fines on Friday for businesses and schools that repeatedly ignore COVID-19 restrictions and mask requirements. Pritzker emphasized that state authorities will focus enforcement on businesses that don’t comply with the rules, not individuals. Springfield Public Schools established a remote learning dress code, forbidding students from wearing pajama pants, slippers or hats while on camera.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Eleven Illinois counties are now in the “warning” level, signalling that COVID metrics in these counties are not safe. Chicago continues to enforce a quarantine on out-of-state travellers from states where the case rate is greater than 15 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 resident population, per day, over a 7-day rolling average.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">More than 28,000 people in Illinois have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in July to date, surpassing the June total (23,000). Almost half of this month's new cases were confirmed this past week. Three counties were issued "warnings" for exceeding their limits on covid-related public health metrics. Governor J.B Pritzker has revised Illinois' reopening strategy by introducing a localized lockdown measure that groups counties into 11 different regions, based largely on shared hospital resources. Chicago has its own region.  No regions have been locked down yet.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinois is experiencing a resurgence: its daily COVID-19 case count exceeded 1,000 for four days last week—the longest stretch of four-digit daily caseloads since a peak in May. The virus has infected a rising number of people 18 to 29 years old in recent weeks, many of whom were likely going to bars and acting unsafely. Although some counties have entered the “warning” designation regarding COVID metrics (e.g. test positivity rate), Governor J.B. Pritzker has yet to announce any rollbacks in terms of the state’s reopening plan.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This weekend, the number of confirmed cases in Illinois increased by 1,000 each day, raising concerns about the state's reopening strategy. However, most counties were below the benchmarks for re-closing in most risk metrics. These include: under 50 new cases per 100,000 people per week, decreasing deaths and ICU admissions, and under 10% positivity rate for tests per week. Even though wearing face masks is mandatory, some health experts are calling on Governor JB Pritzker to re-close indoor dining at bars and restaurants, which can be fertile ground for transmission. The Illinois State Department of Education issued a 60-page document this week with guidelines that schools can follow to reopen safely, offering three scenarios: fully onsite, fully remote, and a mixture of the two. Depending on the situation, it is possible that schools would move between these three scenarios, even during the school year.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 26 Illinois entered its fourth phase of reopening. The state reported its lowest death rates since March. After one week of advancing to phase four, all counties in the state, including Chicago, are below the targets of having less than 50 per 100,000 new cases per week and a daily test positivity rate of less than or equal to 10%. Chicago has issued an emergency order requiring travellers who have been to states experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases to self-isolate for two weeks upon return to the city. In this phase of the reopening plan, movie theaters, zoos, museums and health and fitness centers can reopen with limited capacity (ranging from 25% to 50%). Most notably, indoor gatherings of up to 50 people will be permitted, and restaurants will be able to offer indoor dining. Schools and child care programs with social distancing policies in place (maximum 15 children per group) can also reopen, and hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans can return to work in offices at 50% capacity.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Governor JB Pritzker announced that every region in the state will move to phase 4 of their reopening plan on June 26. As the state prepares to reopen further, the government released a map aimed at telling people if their county is more at-risk for COVID-19; only one county is in the "warning" level, with more than 50 cases per 100,000 people weekly. Phase 4 allows movie theaters, zoos, museums and health and fitness centers to reopen with limited capacity (ranging from 25% to 50% capacity). Restaurants will be able to offer indoor dining, and gatherings of up to 50 people will be permitted. Schools and child care programs with social distancing policies in place (15 children per group max) can also reopen and hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans can return to work. The governor stated that he would not hesitate to revert to phase 3 if cases surge.</p>
