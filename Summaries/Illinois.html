  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 3, Illinois surpassed 300,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The state’s test positivity rate, the metric that experts use to gauge how rapidly the virus is spreading, is lower than last week’s 3.7% at 3.3%. The government scales back reopening when a region reaches or surpasses the state-set threshold of 8% positivity rate for three consecutive days. Accordingly, on September 29, the Governor of Illinois announced that Region 1 would close again due to the rising positivity rates in northwestern Illinois. New restrictions were imposed, including closing indoor bar and restaurant service. Lawmakers in the region responded negatively by claiming that “the positivity rate is only one piece of the puzzle,” and that “Region 1 has not reached warning levels on hospital bed and ICU utilization.” Chicago’s mayor announced on September 28 a plan to ease restrictions put in place, allowing indoor bar service to resume, increasing indoor capacity at restaurants, health and fitness centers, personal services, non-essential retail and all other establishments from 25% to 40%.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinois’ test positivity rate - the metric that experts use to gauge how rapidly the virus is spreading - is still in an acceptable range at 3.7%. As of September 27, 17 counties were at a "warning level." Although southwestern Illinois is on the way to lift mitigation restrictions (if the region reaches a 6.5% positivity rate), northwestern Illinois’ (including Chicago) positivity rate is climbing at a concerning rate. Illinois’ government scales back reopening when a region reaches or surpasses the state-set threshold of 8% positivity rate for three consecutive days.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinoisí test positivity rate -- the metric that experts use to gauge how rapidly the virus is spreading -- is at 3.5%, the lowest since July. Although between 1,500 and 2,000 new cases have been added per day this month, positivity rates have decreased across most of the state thanks to booming testing capacity. Last week, 30 counties were at a "warning level." This week, the number fell to 24. Following a high positivity rate in Regions 4 and 7 in August, indoor dining and bars were closed. As of September 20, Region 7 returned to Phase 4 guidelines and Region 4 is on track to return to Phase 4 by the end of the week. Both regions previously struggled with positivity rates higher than 8%, but the automatic mitigation mechanism and increased testing capacity proved to be successful in lowering the rate.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 9, almost a third of Illinoisí counties are considered at a warning level for COVID-19. The positivity rate for COVID-19 testing surged past the state-imposed 8% benchmark in these counties, which automatically activated mitigation measures. Most of the new mitigation measures focus on restaurants and bars, including a ban on indoor seating, capacity limits and earlier closing times among others. The measures will be reviewed again on September 15. Regarding schooling, some districts have opted to return to online learning as the case numbers increase. However, the state has not mandated any closures yet.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 21, Illinois health officials said that 20 out of 102 counties were now considered at a warning level for COVID-19--with cases of the virus connected to schools being reported. Contact tracing data shows the spikes being fueled by people congregating at weddings, businesses, neighborhood gatherings, parties, bars, and travelling to other states and sports camps. Movie theatres across the state reopened on August 22, as part of Phase 4 of the Restore Illinois plan. Theaters are allowed to host audiences of up to 50 people per auditorium or 50% of normal capacity, whichever is less.  Moviegoers are required to wear masks unless theyíre eating popcorn or drinking soda.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">For the last three days in a row, Region 4 (Southern Illinois) has reported three consecutive days of positivity rates above 8%, automatically triggering the new restrictions under the stateís regional mitigation plan. The new restrictions include the closure of bars, restaurants and casinos in the region by 11 pm, the closure of all party buses, and a reduction in indoor gathering sizes to 25 people or 25 percent of room capacity--whichever is lower. These restrictions will remain in effect for 14 days, and if numbers donít begin to improve, more measures--including the total closure of indoor bars and dining--could be implemented. Some school boards have joined a growing list of districts across the state that have cancelled plans for in-person learning in September.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 8, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported the stateís highest single-day increase in COVID-19 cases in more than two months: 2,190 cases. With cases increasing across the state, Governor J.B. Pritzker announced new rules and fines on Friday for businesses and schools that repeatedly ignore COVID-19 restrictions and mask requirements. Pritzker emphasized that state authorities will focus enforcement on businesses that donít comply with the rules, not individuals. Springfield Public Schools established a remote learning dress code, forbidding students from wearing pajama pants, slippers or hats while on camera.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Eleven Illinois counties are now in the ìwarningî level, signalling that COVID metrics in these counties are not safe. Chicago continues to enforce a quarantine on out-of-state travellers from states where the case rate is greater than 15 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 resident population, per day, over a 7-day rolling average.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">More than 28,000 people in Illinois have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in July to date, surpassing the June total (23,000). Almost half of this month's new cases were confirmed this past week. Three counties were issued "warnings" for exceeding their limits on covid-related public health metrics. Governor J.B Pritzker has revised Illinois' reopening strategy by introducing a localized lockdown measure that groups counties into 11 different regions, based largely on shared hospital resources. Chicago has its own region.  No regions have been locked down yet.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Illinois is experiencing a resurgence: its daily COVID-19 case count exceeded 1,000 for four days last weekóthe longest stretch of four-digit daily caseloads since a peak in May. The virus has infected a rising number of people 18 to 29 years old in recent weeks, many of whom were likely going to bars and acting unsafely. Although some counties have entered the ìwarningî designation regarding COVID metrics (e.g. test positivity rate), Governor J.B. Pritzker has yet to announce any rollbacks in terms of the stateís reopening plan.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This weekend, the number of confirmed cases in Illinois increased by 1,000 each day, raising concerns about the state's reopening strategy. However, most counties were below the benchmarks for re-closing in most risk metrics. These include: under 50 new cases per 100,000 people per week, decreasing deaths and ICU admissions, and under 10% positivity rate for tests per week. Even though wearing face masks is mandatory, some health experts are calling on Governor JB Pritzker to re-close indoor dining at bars and restaurants, which can be fertile ground for transmission. The Illinois State Department of Education issued a 60-page document this week with guidelines that schools can follow to reopen safely, offering three scenarios: fully onsite, fully remote, and a mixture of the two. Depending on the situation, it is possible that schools would move between these three scenarios, even during the school year.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 26 Illinois entered its fourth phase of reopening. The state reported its lowest death rates since March. After one week of advancing to phase four, all counties in the state, including Chicago, are below the targets of having less than 50 per 100,000 new cases per week and a daily test positivity rate of less than or equal to 10%. Chicago has issued an emergency order requiring travellers who have been to states experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases to self-isolate for two weeks upon return to the city. In this phase of the reopening plan, movie theaters, zoos, museums and health and fitness centers can reopen with limited capacity (ranging from 25% to 50%). Most notably, indoor gatherings of up to 50 people will be permitted, and restaurants will be able to offer indoor dining. Schools and child care programs with social distancing policies in place (maximum 15 children per group) can also reopen, and hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans can return to work in offices at 50% capacity.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Governor JB Pritzker announced that every region in the state will move to phase 4 of their reopening plan on June 26. As the state prepares to reopen further, the government released a map aimed at telling people if their county is more at-risk for COVID-19; only one county is in the "warning" level, with more than 50 cases per 100,000 people weekly. Phase 4 allows movie theaters, zoos, museums and health and fitness centers to reopen with limited capacity (ranging from 25% to 50% capacity). Restaurants will be able to offer indoor dining, and gatherings of up to 50 people will be permitted. Schools and child care programs with social distancing policies in place (15 children per group max) can also reopen and hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans can return to work. The governor stated that he would not hesitate to revert to phase 3 if cases surge.</p>
