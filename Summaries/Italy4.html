      In Bergamo, a province in northern Italy’s hardest hit Lombardy region, 57% of residents who had blood tests were found to have COVID-19 antibodies.84 The Italian government released a contact tracing app called Immuni, a voluntary app that uses Bluetooth technology to exchange information between users' phones. While the app can already be downloaded, it is being tested this week in four regions before being extended nationwide. The release of the app was delayed due to citizen resistance because of privacy concerns which has since been mitigated with assurances of anonymity. Despite criticism that 60% of the population must download the app for it to be effective, a poll showed that only 44% of citizens are likely to download the app.85 The app is intended to act as an early warning system for the virus in order to lower the risk of more serious consequences in the event of a second wave in the fall. Mayors in Florence and Venice are aiming to leverage the current crisis to shift towards emphasizing slow tourism within their cities. These cities intend to cater to tourists that stay in the city and experience the museums and restaurants, rather than to day-trip tourists in the future.86
