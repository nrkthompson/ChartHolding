      New outbreaks were documented almost immediately after Japan fully lifted their nationwide state of emergency. The most notable outbreak was in Fukuoka, a southwest Japanese city which, after 23 days of no new cases, has reported more than 40 infections. Antibody tests were randomly given to people aged 20 or older in Tokyo on June 1, with a goal of testing around 10,000 people by the end of June. A contact-tracing app is being developed that exchanges Bluetooth signals between users within a certain distance of each other and notifies them of their exposure to people who have tested COVID+. The government reveals no intention to reintroduce a state of emergency; businesses remain fully reopened and as of June 1 in-person classes resumed in most of the 47 prefectures. Some restrictions remain in place in Tokyo and other prefectures with regards to high-risk facilities like music venues and gyms. As of June 1, travel between prefectures is permitted with discretion. Many amusement parks are reopening across the country. Professional sports are returning with no spectators in the stadiums on June 19. Events can now be held with 100 people indoors if this does not exceed a 50% capacity and can be expanded to include up to 200 people in outdoor venues. Japan is now considering reopening its borders to business travellers from countries with low levels of infections and strong economic ties, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are Trans-Pacific Partnership members.
