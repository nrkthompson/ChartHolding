  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia has maintained a low level of new infections for weeks. The provincial state of emergency is extended until July 7. Antibody testing is offered to all residents on Cormorant Island to learn more about the spread of the virus. International travellers returning to B.C. are required to self-isolate for 14 days and submit a self-isolation plan to health officials. The B.C. premier announced on June 24 that the province moved to phase 3 of their reopening plan, allowing hotels, resorts, parks, select entertainment venues and the film industry to reopen. Most businesses are now open with restrictions. Mass gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited. Gyms, fitness centres, restaurants, cafes and pubs are operating under physical distancing rules. Groups of 50 people are allowed to visit museums, galleries, and libraries. Appointments are normally required for in-person services like hairdressers and counselling. While not all parks and campgrounds are open, overnight camping is permitted for B.C. residents. Travel within BC can resume with careful plans and following personal health practice, while travellers outside the province are asked to exercise extra caution. Students are returning to school on a voluntary and part-time basis. A full return is not expected until September.</p>
