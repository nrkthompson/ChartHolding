  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in British Columbia has dropped slightly over the past week to around 700, lower than the infection rate experienced two weeks ago. On December 5, Fraser Health changed its exposure notifications for school communities: a letter will now be sent out “specifically informing people in a class whether they have been exposed or not.” All current province-wide restrictions will remain in effect until December 7. All indoor adult team sports are now prohibited.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia continued to report a very high level of daily new cases over the past week, occasionally topping 900. The provincial state of emergency has been extended through December 8. Masks are required to be worn by all British Columbians over 11 years old in most indoor public settings. The strict province-wide restrictions will remain in effect until December 7. COVID-19 antibody tests became available at LifeLabs clinics last week.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new cases is still on the rise in British Columbia, staying mostly above 500 per day last week. A mandatory mask policy has not been implemented, but the government is encouraging the use of masks. On November 19, the previous regional orders were expanded province-wide. Indoor and outdoor social gatherings are prohibited, with the exception of baptisms, funerals and weddings. Group physical activities are banned until at least the end of the year. All businesses and worksites are required to conduct active daily screening of all on-site workers using their COVID-19 safety plans, and employers are encouraged to support work-from-home options. Non-essential travel is strongly discouraged.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in British Columbia has stayed above 500 over the past week, with the highest hospitalization numbers since the spring. The provincial state of emergency has been extended through November 24. No additional restrictions have been introduced so far. Police and other enforcement officers have been granted the ability to issue tickets for restriction violations in the Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health regions, which are under the enhanced restrictions announced last week. The other regions in B.C. remain at Phase 3 of the provincial reopening plan.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There has been a record-high increase in the number of new cases in British Columbia over the past week. Between November 2 and 7, the number of active cases grew from just above 2,900 to over 3,700. In response to the surge in cases, the provincial health officer issued orders that require “all individuals, places of work and businesses in the Lower Mainland and the Fraser Valley”, the two worst affected regions, to significantly reduce their level of social interaction and travel. In these regions: social gatherings of any size outside of the immediate household are banned, indoor group physical activities that cannot ensure compliance with social distancing are suspended, non-essential travel in and out of the two regions is restricted, and all workplaces are required to conduct daily health screenings of all onsite employees using the province’s COVID-19 symptom checklist. All restrictions are in place until at least November 23. All other regions in B.C. are staying at Phase 3 of the provincial reopening plan.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in British Columbia has approached 300 over the past week. The provincial state of emergency has been extended through November 10. A new provincial health officer order was put in place on October 26 to limit gatherings in private homes to a maximum of the immediate household plus six others. The provincial health officer also granted powers to regional medical health officers to issue stricter public health orders for their jurisdictions. The Fraser Health Authority, the region which has seen the most cases in the province, is recommending against gatherings of any kind if they involve people who do not live in the same household. B.C. is still at Phase 3 of its reopening plan. Most businesses are open subject to restrictions.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The average number of daily new cases in British Columbia has increased to above 200 per day, but the healthcare system has yet to feel the impact of the increase in cases.

  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new infections in British Columbia is still on the rise. The provincial state of emergency has been extended again through September 29. A new mouth rinse, gargle, and spit test -- which was developed in the province -- is being introduced for students from kindergarten to grade 12 to help make it easier to check whether they have COVID-19. The test can be done by parents or children themselves. To better enforce COVID-19 public safety, the range of activities subject to ticketing and enforcement has been expanded. Starting September 20, activities subject to fines include nightclub operations and onsite liquor consumption after 10pm. BC is still at Phase 3 of its reopening plan. Most businesses are open subject to restrictions.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The average number of daily new infections in British Columbia has climbed above 100. To avoid overwhelming the healthcare system with both COVID-19 and seasonal flu, the provincial government announced an enhanced fall flu immunization campaign with the purchase of 1,965,000 doses of the flu vaccine ó 450,000 more than what was planned. The provincial government also plans to hire up to 5,000 new staff across the long-term care system. British Columbia has set aside about $784 million to implement the campaign, which also includes building out COVID-19 testing capacity for the fall and winter to approximately 20,000 tests per day to help with diagnosis. Surge capacity will also be put in effect at key hospitals, as well as a staged approach to regionally managing surges in demand. Due to the recent spike in cases, the government ordered the closure of all nightclubs on September 8. Restaurants, pubs and bars are asked to end the sale of liquor at 10 pm and to close by 11p m, unless serving food.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new infections in British Columbia is still increasing. Anyone onboard a TransLink or BC Transit bus, boat or train, as well as passengers onboard BC Ferries vessels, will be required to wear a mask starting August 24. B.C. is still at Phase 3 of its reopening plan. Most businesses are open subject to restrictions. Updated K-12 operational guidelines for COVID-19 have been distributed to school districts. Masks will be required for staff, middle and secondary students in high traffic areas such as buses and in common areas such as hallways, or anytime outside of their learning group when social distancing cannot be maintained. Additional funding will be provided to support the purchase of up to 1.5 million masks, enough for every public-school staff member and student to have at least two masks. Another key health and safety measure is the establishment of learning groups consisting of students and staff who remain together throughout the school quarter, semester or year; these could be made up of a single class or multiple classes of students. Learning groups will sometimes join for activities like physical education or music, or they may be secondary students taking the same courses. The province is also providing an additional $45.6 million to school districts for enhanced cleaning, handwashing stations, reusable masks and other safety measures.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia now faces an alarming and sustained surge in daily new cases. According to new modelling released by health officials, the daily number could soon surpass the numbers seen at the height of the crisis in March and April. The modelling also warns that the reproductive number has been hovering slightly above 1.0 since June. Young adults are now overrepresented in B.C.'s infection tally. A surge of patients is causing backlogs at some testing sites in the Lower Mainland. Health officials are planning to ramp up testing in the fall as B.C. braces for a second wave.  The target is 20,000 tests a day. B.C. is still at Phase 3 of its reopening plan. Most businesses are open, subject to restrictions. Updated K-12 operating guidelines for COVID-19 and other restart materials are set to be released this week.

An order was issued on July 30 restricting non-resident travel to Haida Gwaii from the B.C. coast to help control the recent outbreak there. B.C. is still at phase three of its reopening plan. Most businesses are open subject to restrictions. In terms of the upcoming school year starting in September, full-time instruction is expected for all students for the maximum instructional time possible within learning group limits that vary based on the level of education.

British Columbians have been urged to recommit to measures like keeping groups small and meeting outside whenever possible. The government has opted to stick with its strategy of education and advice rather than enforceable measures like mandatory mask wearing. Health officials are imposing stricter rules on B.C. bars and nightclubs as the province's COVID-19 caseload continues to rise. It was announced on July 22 that patrons in those venues need to stay in assigned seating areas, and are prohibited from standing at the bar to order drinks. The same regulations apply in restaurants, including a six-person limit for group dining. Nightclubs are only allowed to open as lounges or to host events, and can only allow a maximum of 50 people. Events must also end by 11pm. A new public health order has also been issued to limit the number of visitors (depending on size) to vacation rental properties and houseboats.</p>
