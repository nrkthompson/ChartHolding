  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia now faces an alarming and sustained surge in daily new cases. According to new modelling released by health officials, the daily number could soon surpass the numbers seen at the height of the crisis in March and April. The modelling also warns that the reproductive number has been hovering slightly above 1.0 since June. Young adults are now overrepresented in B.C.'s infection tally. A surge of patients is causing backlogs at some testing sites in the Lower Mainland. Health officials are planning to ramp up testing in the fall as B.C. braces for a second wave.  The target is 20,000 tests a day. B.C. is still at Phase 3 of its reopening plan. Most businesses are open, subject to restrictions. Updated K-12 operating guidelines for COVID-19 and other restart materials are set to be released this week. School districts and independent schools have until August 21 to finalize their restart plan before sending it to the Ministry of Education for approval. The BC Teachers’ Federation has expressed concern over the limited time left for frontline educators to prepare.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia continues to experience slight increases in daily new infections. The B.C. government has formally extended the provincial state of emergency through August 18.

  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia experienced a rise in daily new infections over the past week. The state of emergency has been extended until August 4. British Columbians have been urged to recommit to measures like keeping groups small and meeting outside whenever possible. The government has opted to stick with its strategy of education and advice rather than enforceable measures like mandatory mask wearing. Health officials are imposing stricter rules on B.C. bars and nightclubs as the province's COVID-19 caseload continues to rise. It was announced on July 22 that patrons in those venues need to stay in assigned seating areas, and are prohibited from standing at the bar to order drinks. The same regulations apply in restaurants, including a six-person limit for group dining. Nightclubs are only allowed to open as lounges or to host events, and can only allow a maximum of 50 people. Events must also end by 11pm. A new public health order has also been issued to limit the number of visitors (depending on size) to vacation rental properties and houseboats.</p>

They suggest that fewer than 1% of B.C. residents have antibodies for the virus. The premier announced that nearly $2 billion was coming from the federal government to support the province’s restart plan amid the pandemic. Many postsecondary education institutions have decided to continue with mostly online delivery this fall—delivering hands-on, experiential training, where needed, with physical distancing.</p>
