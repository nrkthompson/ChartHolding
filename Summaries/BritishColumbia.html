  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia experienced a rise in daily new infections over the past week. The state of emergency has been extended until August 4. British Columbians have been urged to recommit to measures like keeping groups small and meeting outside whenever possible. The government has opted to stick with its strategy of education and advice rather than enforceable measures like mandatory mask wearing. Health officials are imposing stricter rules on B.C. bars and nightclubs as the province's COVID-19 caseload continues to rise. It was announced on July 22 that patrons in those venues need to stay in assigned seating areas, and are prohibited from standing at the bar to order drinks. The same regulations apply in restaurants, including a six-person limit for group dining. Nightclubs are only allowed to open as lounges or to host events, and can only allow a maximum of 50 people. Events must also end by 11pm. A new public health order has also been issued to limit the number of visitors (depending on size) to vacation rental properties and houseboats.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia has maintained a relatively stable level of daily new infections in the past week. The Provincial Health Officer expressed concern after nearly 30 cases have been connected to Canada Day parties in Kelowna. The results of serology testing in the province were released on July 16.  They suggest that fewer than 1% of B.C. residents have antibodies for the virus. The premier announced that nearly $2 billion was coming from the federal government to support the province’s restart plan amid the pandemic. Many postsecondary education institutions have decided to continue with mostly online delivery this fall—delivering hands-on, experiential training, where needed, with physical distancing.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia experienced an increase in new infections last week, though the number of daily new cases remained low. The province is at Phase 3 of its reopening plan. Most businesses are open, subject to public health restrictions. Mass gatherings of more than 50 people are still prohibited. The government is working with all public postsecondary institutions to support their planning for the 2020/2021 academic year.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia has continued to report a limited level of new infections for the past few weeks. Health officials declared all community outbreaks over on July 2. The provincial state of emergency is expected to expire on July 7. British Columbia is still at Phase 3 of its reopening plan. Most businesses are open subject to restrictions. Mass gatherings of more than 50 people are still prohibited. People can travel freely within the province in a careful manner. Starting in July, residents at long-term care facilities and seniors’ assisted living residences will be able to visit with one designated family member or friend, which may be expanded in the future. The government is working with all the public postsecondary institutions to support their planning for the 2020/2021 academic year.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">British Columbia has maintained a low level of new infections for weeks. The provincial state of emergency is extended until July 7. Antibody testing is offered to all residents on Cormorant Island to learn more about the spread of the virus. International travellers returning to B.C. are required to self-isolate for 14 days and submit a self-isolation plan to health officials. The B.C. premier announced on June 24 that the province moved to phase 3 of their reopening plan, allowing hotels, resorts, parks, select entertainment venues and the film industry to reopen. Most businesses are now open with restrictions. Mass gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited. Gyms, fitness centres, restaurants, cafes and pubs are operating under physical distancing rules. Groups of 50 people are allowed to visit museums, galleries, and libraries. Appointments are normally required for in-person services like hairdressers and counselling. While not all parks and campgrounds are open, overnight camping is permitted for B.C. residents. Travel within BC can resume with careful plans and following personal health practice, while travellers outside the province are asked to exercise extra caution. Students are returning to school on a voluntary and part-time basis. A full return is not expected until September.</p>
