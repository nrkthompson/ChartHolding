  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 9, it has been 100 days since the last case of COVID-19 was acquired locally from an unknown source in New Zealand. To discover if there has been undetected transmission within the community, pop-up testing stations are being set up across the country. On August 6, the government announced that it would start the trial of the CovidCard, a Bluetooth-based device worn on a lanyard when in public. The device works independently from the contact tracing app. New Zealanders are encouraged to store sufficient masks in preparation for the possible outbreaks in the future. The legislation charging certain returnees part of the costs for their stay in isolation facilities passed all stages and will come into force around mid-August. The government is also in the process of developing technological measures such as CCTV, door alarms, and motion detection systems for managed isolation and quarantine facilities. The Ministry of Health has released its Aged Residential Care Action Plan, which addresses the response to COVID-19 within the aged care sector. Although business leaders have been pushing for privately-run managed isolation to accelerate border reopening, the government is not considering the proposal at the moment.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has gone through more than three months without a locally acquired case from an unknown source. However, there are increasing concerns that unwell New Zealanders are refusing to get tested and that COVID-19 patients are not always honest when revealing their contact histories. In response to a visitor who tested positive after leaving New Zealand, targeted testing has taken place in the communities where the visitor had been to check for signs of community transmission. The Ministry of Health has announced that all 12 public health units are now using the same contact tracing software, which could improve the country’s overall contact tracing capacity. An update to the software allowing users to manually enter their digital diary was released on July 30. A bill introduced in Parliament on July 29 would charge temporary visa holders--or New Zealanders who enter the country temporarily or leave and return--for the cost of their government-managed isolation. The system could begin before late August. Normal life goes on without restrictions within the border. Two of the country's busiest airports have sketched out their plans to physically divide operations for an international travel bubble should the government announce one. Having put a hold on new bookings in early July to help the government manage quarantine capacity, Air New Zealand has extended the freeze until August 9.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has reported no new locally acquired infections for nearly three months. The low level of tests conducted recently has prompted the government to seek further adjustments to its testing criteria. A survey is going out to general practitioners to better understand what is happening with regard to the number of tests being conducted. The minister in charge of government-managed isolation has said that New Zealand is close to exhausting its nationwide capacity at isolation facilities. The minister also highlighted the importance of a police presence at the facilities after five people escaped their isolation hotel on July 24. The exemption process for people leaving isolation early is now operational, and a new website and web app for exemption applications is expected in the next two weeks. The risk of spreading COVID-19 through nurses working across different facilities simultaneously has received attention recently. A new quota system for airlines is being developed to ensure that New Zealand has enough isolation spaces available at any time to match the number of people flying into the country. The Minister of Health has announced a financial boost for public health services, setting aside more than $300 million for new PPE, contact tracing, tele-health services and a mass vaccination program for the possible COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">All of the active cases in New Zealand were imported and identified during their isolation immediately after arrival. There are no hospitalized cases of COVID-19. The government has been seeking and evaluating candidate facilities to expand the capacity of government-managed isolation and quarantine. High-risk patients with respiratory illnesses are now included in the prioritized targets for COVID-19 testing. The clinical criteria for recovery from COVID-19 has been brought in line with Australian standards following a review, with 72 hours of no symptoms now needed for the case to be considered resolved (rather than 48). Pharmac, the national medicine-buying agency in New Zealand, has been seeking information from pharmaceutical companies about their plans to provide vaccines to New Zealanders, or if they plan to allow New Zealand to manufacture its own supply should a vaccine become available. The Prime Minister has outlined the government’s plan to implement local lockdowns should community transmission return to New Zealand. The reopening of borders is not expected to proceed without significant epidemiological improvement in other jurisdictions. Since roughly 20% of children under 5 are not returning to early childhood centres after lockdown, many centres are struggling due to financial adversity.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although a couple of new cases were recorded among returnees in government-managed isolation, New Zealand has managed to maintain zero locally acquired cases for more than a month. The government is seeking ways to perform 4,000 tests per day at the border and encourage people to use the entry log system. To relieve the burden on managing returnees, a temporary hold has been put on new flight bookings, and those already booked will be admitted based on availability of quarantine facilities. Following two recent escapes from government-managed isolation, the government announced that there will be a constant police presence at every managed isolation and quarantine facility in New Zealand effective July 9. A massive privacy breach that published the personal details of recently confirmed cases is under investigation.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has had very few cases in the past few days, none of which were acquired locally. The Health Minister resigned on July 2 over personal lockdown breaches. A COVID-19 All-of-Government Response Group was established on July 1 under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to coordinate the future response to the pandemic, following the deactivation of the National Crisis Management Centre. Domestically, the testing criteria have been altered to prioritize people with symptoms who have had contact with overseas travellers or confirmed cases. The government-managed quarantine and isolation facilities will be increased from 24 to 27 this week as more Kiwis return to the country. The government is once again allowing people to leave government-managed quarantine earlier on compassionate grounds, under a tighter process. People are advised against overseas travel despite the European Union’s decision to reopen its borders to New Zealand travellers. The Prime Minister has suggested that those who choose to take non-essential international travel should be ready to bear the cost of their quarantine hotel stay upon return, while the co-payment scheme is still being discussed. The government also stated that it will remain cautious and has no plans to alter the existing border control measures. This comes despite an appeal to speed up border reopening by influential New Zealanders in the scientific community, the administration, and the business world. New Zealand has joined the global facility COVAX to co-invest in vaccine candidates and incentivize manufacturers to produce more.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 26, New Zealand has 14 active cases that were all imported and had been isolated upon arrival. Concerns arose over the loose observation of physical distancing and mask wearing on the flights bringing residents home. With growing anxiety over new infections and the arrival of the cold and flu season, testing centres across the country have been experiencing high demand--although many community assessment centres are already closed. Random testing is also being considered, especially among workers at airports or isolation hotels. The government is tightening rules at borders as more residents return. All people leaving government managed isolation facilities must now present a negative COVID-19 test. The housing minister was appointed to take control over isolation and quarantine management. Additionally, the opposition called for the health minister’s resignation over accusations that people have been able to leave quarantine without being tested. All isolation and quarantine facilities will be under inspection starting July. The government is seeking more isolation space at different facilities and a co-payment scheme is being considered for the quarantine hotel bills. Normal life continues domestically without restrictions. Some specified sports participants and infrastructure project workers are being permitted to enter New Zealand. The ban on cruise ships has been renewed. Crews from foreign boats (including cargo boats and other boats) that have been permitted entry are required to isolate, unless they have been on the ship for 28 continuous days without showing symptoms.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand ended its 24-day streak of zero new infections on June 16 after identifying two new cases from people who had been permitted to visit relatives who were on their deathbed. There is increasing concern about people returning from overseas and breaking quarantine rules. The contact tracing app has been upgraded to notify users about possible contact with confirmed cases. Hospitals have been busy dealing with postponed elective surgeries and increasing demand for normal emergency services. New Zealanders continue to enjoy their lives like normal while still being asked to stay vigilant. No legal requirements persist for businesses and services, but keeping entry logs by using QR codes is encouraged. Borders remain closed to foreign travellers and the opposition party has been urging the government to move faster in opening borders to tertiary international students, who make large contributions to New Zealand industries. The government granted entry last week to partners and dependents of New Zealand citizens and residents. Others with a compelling need will also be offered an entry exception.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With no active cases within its borders, New Zealand moved to a “Prepare” alert level on midnight June 8. There have been no new cases for more than 2 weeks. Intensive testing will continue. Border controls will be enhanced to better handle imported cases. Beginning the week of June 8, anyone entering New Zealand has to be tested twice during their mandatory two-week quarantine. With physical distancing and mass gathering restrictions completely lifted, people can now return to their normal life despite the need to stay vigilant and practice good hygiene. Schools and workplaces are fully opened. Businesses and individuals are still recommended to keep track of those they come in contact with. Domestic transport can operate at full capacity with no restrictions. New Zealand borders remain closed to all foreign travellers, however, with the film industry returning to work, special permissions are granted to a limited number of foreign crew members.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has seen no new cases for 13 days in a row and no single case is still receiving hospital care. Dozens of community-based testing centres are closing around the country and people can be tested by general practitioners. Antibody testing is being conducted among high-risk populations in the Southern Region to reveal cases missed during swab testing. The opposition party is pressuring the government to move to the “Prepare” alert level immediately.Most businesses have reopened with restrictions. Social gatherings can now be held with up to 100 people. Students at all ages have physically returned to school. The Prime Minister revealed the prospect of life under the “Prepare” alert level as everyone having access to businesses and services without restrictions and limits on the maximum number of people attending gatherings. Cabinet will consider moving to the lower alert level on June 8. Still being precautious, the Prime Minister expects their borders to open to Australia by September.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has experienced almost no new cases of COVID-19 as its last in-patient still receiving treatment for the virus is discharged from hospital. New Zealand’s Health Ministry launched a new app providing information to medical professionals on May 27, while some district  health boards have refused to adopt the previous contact tracing app due to concerns over its functionality. Effective May 29, up to 100 people will be allowed to gather in public and private venues - a significant increase from the previous limit of 10. Health authorities have urged event organizers to keep a detailed record of gatherings and their attendees where possible. Employers are being encouraged to consider more flexible work arrangements, including remote work, and longer hours over fewer work days. Air New Zealand is maintaining a significantly reduced flight network until at least the of August. New Zealand’s Prime Minister remains hesitant over opening exclusive travel routes with Australia, and expects that the trans-Tasman travel bubble will not come into being until at least the end of June. Restrictions are being reassessed every 2 weeks, and the country is expected to fully reopen by June 22.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 19, New Zealand’s government released a contact tracing app that allows users to log the places they have recently visited. On May 13, a bill was passed - under intense scrutiny from the Opposition - that would allow New Zealand’s Health Minister to legally enforce alert level rules after lifting the country’s state of emergency. Residents are now being allowed to visit stores, malls, cafés, restaurants, bars, and other public spaces. Contact records will no longer be a requirement for retailers. The number of people allowed to gather in one place has been limited to 10. Children are returning to school (with the attendance rate at about 80%), and early learning centers were allowed to open on May 18 - subject to strict physical distancing and hygiene rules. As both countries see promising trends in terms of control over the virus, New Zealand and Australia will proceed to establish a trans-Tasman travel “bubble” if deemed safe.</p>
