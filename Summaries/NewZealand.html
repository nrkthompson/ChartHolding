  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No active cases of COVID-19 remain in New Zealand. Businesses and activities go on as normal without outstanding restrictions. Starting January 18, the submission of a negative COVID-19 test result before entering New Zealand will be gradually expanded to all travellers except those from Australia, Antarctica and several Pacific nations. Travellers will also be tested during their first day upon arrival. Starting January 21, people from the Cook Islands will be able to enter New Zealand without the need to quarantine. As early as April, 1,000 foreign students will be allowed to enter the country to complete their studies.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There are no active domestic cases in New Zealand. The government has announced additional funding for its COVID-19 response, allocating $1.1 billion until June 2022 to bolster testing and contact tracing.  It has also allocated $1.7 billion for government-managed isolation following a report that identified failings with its testing strategy for border staff. The health ministry has outlined its plan to cope with a possible resurgence, which advises different actions based on three scenarios with different risks of virus exposure. People could be asked to stay at home again in the worst-case scenario. Another 18.32 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been secured from AstraZeneca and Novavax, enabling the government to offer every New Zealander free vaccination. The expectation is that the first vaccines will be delivered to front-line workers as early as in the second quarter of 2021.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There are no active domestic cases of COVID-19 remaining in New Zealand. The official contact tracing app received a Bluetooth upgrade on December 10 to also enable proximity-based contact detection, a common feature of contact tracing apps around the world. The New Zealand government remains cautious over the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. The entire country remains at Alert Level 1, with no restrictions on movement, gathering, businesses, or activities.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No new community cases have been recorded in New Zealand over the past week. The managed isolation emergency allocation criteria have been expanded to a two-tiered system, allowing more people with urgent needs to get a place at isolation facilities. The government is considering long-term funding for the expensive program of government-managed isolation, which is due to go over budget before the end of the year. There continues to be no restrictions on movement, gathering, businesses, or activities in New Zealand.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No new domestic community cases have been reported in New Zealand over the past week. Additional restrictions have been imposed on staff at government-managed isolation facilities in Auckland as a safety precaution, though a labour shortage at the facilities is becoming a concern. The whole country remains at Alert Level 1, with no restrictions on movement, gathering, businesses, or activities.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Few locally acquired cases were reported in New Zealand over the past week. New testing rules will be introduced for border workers on November 26, which requires weekly testing for high-risk groups; all others will be tested every two weeks. Planning for the government-managed isolation facilities has been criticized after more than 1,000 empty rooms were discovered while some people remain stranded overseas. The government has reached an in-principle agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica to purchase more than three million doses of its vaccine.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Only a few new community cases have been identified in New Zealand over the past week. In order to guard against potential community transmission, starting on November 19, masks will be mandatory on all domestic flights nationwide and on public transport in Auckland. Taxi and Uber drivers are also required to wear masks in Auckland. One hundred additional rooms will be available at government-managed isolation facilities between December 13 and 23 to guard against a spike in demand. It has been reported that some government-managed isolation facilities do not have “a good supply and distribution of the high-quality N95 masks.” Nurses working at those facilities are threatening to stop working if access to the equipment cannot be guaranteed.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Single-digit new community cases were reported in New Zealand over the past week, all of which have been linked to government-managed isolation facilities. An 8-week wastewater pilot program is being rolled out across the country to detect the possible existence of COVID-19 in the community. A new ministerial-level position in New Zealand’s cabinet has been created for its COVID-19 response. The minister will be responsible for the pandemic and other health challenges at the same time. The whole country remains at alert level 1, with no restrictions on movement, gathering, businesses, or activities.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There have been no new community cases in New Zealand. Due to a possible link to the latest community cases, mandatory testing of all international maritime workers will begin this week. A week-long trial of a Bluetooth-enabled contact tracing card will start on November 9 to test its real-world functionality and its compatibility with existing contact tracing methods. All of New Zealand is at Alert Level 1, with no restrictions on movement, gathering, businesses, or activities.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A small number of community cases were reported over the past week in New Zealand, all believed to be connected to the new case last week. Health authorities are now worried about a lack of community testing centers operating in Auckland, especially when there are none that are open on weekends. As the number of New Zealanders returning from overseas declines and more vacancies at government managed isolation facilities are available, the minister of health said that more essential workers and international students would be admitted into the country. Due to the pandemic, New Zealand is facing medication shortages which force patients to adjust prescriptions or switch to alternative medications. All of New Zealand remains at alert level 1, with no restrictions on movement, gathering, businesses, or activities.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">One new community case was reported on October 18, after New Zealand previously eliminated all community spread for a second time, with “the risk of onward transmission contained.” Testing has been scaled up in order to detect any possible transmission due to the community case. “Corrective action and training” were carried out at a government managed isolation facility in Auckland after a third-party booking not based on isolation needs was made at the facility. All of New Zealand remains at alert level 1, with no restrictions on movement, gathering, businesses, or activities.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No active cases remain in New Zealand. The government announced that 250 international graduate students will be granted entry into New Zealand, with the first batch expected to arrive next month while most will arrive early next year. The whole country, including Auckland, is now at Alert Level 1, meaning that there are no longer restrictions on movement, gathering, businesses, or other activities. Travel restrictions and border controls remain, while wearing a mask is recommended on public transit. The government has agreed to purchase 1.5 million doses of a candidate vaccine, which would enable 750,000 people to get vaccinated. It remains to be decided who will be prioritized when the vaccine is ready to be distributed.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No locally acquired cases of COVID-19 have been reported in New Zealand in the past week and no-one is receiving hospital care due to COVID-19. To better manage the capacity of government-run isolation facilities, a voucher allocation system was launched on October 5 to enable registration for isolation space. The system will be compulsory starting November 3 and passengers will need to present the voucher to board their flight to New Zealand. New requirements for personal protection equipment use and isolation from New Zealand communities came into effect for flight crews on October 5. The prime minister has confirmed that Auckland will join the rest of New Zealand at alert level 1 on October 7; after that date, there will be no restrictions on movement, gathering or activities across the country once again.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Almost no new cases have been recorded in New Zealand in recent weeks. The health ministry has put forward a new testing plan to target “high-risk” workers in the places where Aucklanders normally frequent over the next two weeks. The ministry is also developing a protocol concerning people who have recovered from COVID-19 but later test positive for low levels of the virus, and will set up a panel to handle these cases. Starting on September 28, the COVID-19 leave support scheme will be expanded to cover any person who is directed to self-isolate. As the alert level goes down across the country, some general practitioners have been concerned about a halted supply of personal protective equipment when they are not taking test swabs. The government has agreed to “enter a legally-binding agreement for the auction to purchase approved COVID-19 vaccines” through the COVAX facility. The current alert levels, level 2 for Auckland and 1 for the rest of the country, are likely to stay unchanged until at least October 5.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has once again come close to eradicating COVID-19 within its borders. However, while the country has been able to contact trace most cases, authorities are worried about the identified close contacts not moving into isolation fast enough. Some additional defence force personnel have been assigned to the isolation hotels in Hamilton to help with security work. From now on, public transport operators, including airlines, buses and trains, no longer need to maintain any seating restrictions or passenger capacity limits at level 2 and above. Mask use will continue to be compulsory. The government has decided to move Auckland to Alert Level 2. The gathering limit in the city was expanded to allow groups of up to 100, effective September 24. The rest of the country will be at Alert Level 1 from September 22. There will be no restrictions on movement, gatherings, businesses, or services. However, people are encouraged to stay vigilant and take records of close contacts. That level will be in place for at least 14 days, with the cabinet set to review those settings on October 5. The government has loosened the criteria for admitting overseas workers to access critical labour shortages experienced by several industries.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealandís resurgence of COVID-19 has started to decline, with low levels of daily new infections reported. Health authorities have been working to boost testing capacity in Auckland. As of September 7, all border workers must undergo mandatory testing for COVID-19. 97% of staff in government managed isolation facilities were tested between August 21 and 27 and none returned positive results. Trials of CovidCard, the Bluetooth-based contact tracing device, are still ongoing despite some major contributors pulling out of development. Almost 700 workers at private medical laboratories went on strike last week for better pay, with some impact on the testing turnaround time expected. Partial strikes also happened among primary healthcare workers. Out of caution, Auckland has moved down to Alert Level 2.5 on August 31, with some new restrictions introduced. Most gatherings are limited to 10 people, with authorized funerals and tangihanga limited to 50 people. On the same date, masks were made mandatory on public transport and planes across the country for everyone over the age of 12. Starting September 4, public transport operators are required to display QR codes to facilitate entry logging for passengers.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 25, it has been two weeks since the re-emergence of COVID-19 in New Zealand. Almost 100,000 tests have been processed over the past week. The prime minister has announced that the government is deploying an extra 500 defence force personnel at government managed isolation facilities, which could reduce reliance on private security firms. The government has also been testing technologies such as thermal CCTV to help manage the facilities. COVID testing is now mandatory for all staff working at the border. The Director-General of Health is urging district health boards to upgrade hospital IT systems. There have been growing calls to review and revise New Zealandís generic pandemic plan--last updated after the 1918 flu--to address the issues of vaccines and the border. The election has been delayed for four weeks to October 17, which has been welcomed by most of the parties. Taking into consideration the risk associated with regional travel, the prime minister has announced that current restrictions -- Auckland at alert level 3 and the rest of the country at level 2 -- will remain until at least August 30. Masks will also be mandatory as of August 31 when using public transport at level 2 and above. Two major changes to travel in Auckland came into effect starting August 24. People can now transit through Auckland without stopping in order to work. In addition, patients who need to travel to Auckland for hospital appointments do not need an exemption now. While Aucklandís schools are shut for the level 3 lockdown, the education ministry says they can apply for permission to have in-person learning in bubbles of up to 20 senior students. The New Zealand Aged Care Association has reiterated that its 600 rest homes would still be operating at alert level 4.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After reporting the first, locally-acquired new cases in almost four months, the number of active cases in the community has risen quickly to 58--as of August 17. The testing and contact tracing regime has been expanded to handle the sudden high demand; record-high numbers of tests have been completed and processed over the past few days. It is now mandatory for frontline border staff to be tested. All businesses and services are required to display the QR code for the contract tracing app at all entry points from August 19. Shortly after the discovery of the locally acquired cases, Auckland was placed under alert level 3, and the rest of the country under level 2, for three days. This was later extended until August 26. In Auckland, people are asked to stay in their bubbles and work from home unless they are essential workers. Bars and restaurants have to close except for delivery service, and gatherings are only permitted for funerals and weddings-up to a maximum of 10 people. Childcare and schooling are only available for essential workers. Roadblocks and checkpoints have been set up at the exits from Auckland. For the rest of the country, up to 100 people are allowed at gatherings and businesses can open with restrictions, including social distancing and entry logging. All rest homes in New Zealand are under a self-imposed full lockdown now.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 9, it has been 100 days since the last case of COVID-19 was acquired locally from an unknown source in New Zealand. To discover if there has been undetected transmission within the community, pop-up testing stations are being set up across the country. On August 6, the government announced that it would start the trial of the CovidCard, a Bluetooth-based device worn on a lanyard when in public. The device works independently from the contact tracing app. New Zealanders are encouraged to store sufficient masks in preparation for the possible outbreaks in the future. The legislation charging certain returnees part of the costs for their stay in isolation facilities passed all stages and will come into force around mid-August. The government is also in the process of developing technological measures such as CCTV, door alarms, and motion detection systems for managed isolation and quarantine facilities. The Ministry of Health has released its Aged Residential Care Action Plan, which addresses the response to COVID-19 within the aged care sector. Although business leaders have been pushing for privately-run managed isolation to accelerate border reopening, the government is not considering the proposal at the moment.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has gone through more than three months without a locally acquired case from an unknown source. However, there are increasing concerns that unwell New Zealanders are refusing to get tested and that COVID-19 patients are not always honest when revealing their contact histories. In response to a visitor who tested positive after leaving New Zealand, targeted testing has taken place in the communities where the visitor had been to check for signs of community transmission. The Ministry of Health has announced that all 12 public health units are now using the same contact tracing software, which could improve the countryís overall contact tracing capacity. An update to the software allowing users to manually enter their digital diary was released on July 30. A bill introduced in Parliament on July 29 would charge temporary visa holders--or New Zealanders who enter the country temporarily or leave and return--for the cost of their government-managed isolation. The system could begin before late August. Normal life goes on without restrictions within the border. Two of the country's busiest airports have sketched out their plans to physically divide operations for an international travel bubble should the government announce one. Having put a hold on new bookings in early July to help the government manage quarantine capacity, Air New Zealand has extended the freeze until August 9.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has reported no new locally acquired infections for nearly three months. The low level of tests conducted recently has prompted the government to seek further adjustments to its testing criteria. A survey is going out to general practitioners to better understand what is happening with regard to the number of tests being conducted. The minister in charge of government-managed isolation has said that New Zealand is close to exhausting its nationwide capacity at isolation facilities. The minister also highlighted the importance of a police presence at the facilities after five people escaped their isolation hotel on July 24. The exemption process for people leaving isolation early is now operational, and a new website and web app for exemption applications is expected in the next two weeks. The risk of spreading COVID-19 through nurses working across different facilities simultaneously has received attention recently. A new quota system for airlines is being developed to ensure that New Zealand has enough isolation spaces available at any time to match the number of people flying into the country. The Minister of Health has announced a financial boost for public health services, setting aside more than $300 million for new PPE, contact tracing, tele-health services and a mass vaccination program for the possible COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">All of the active cases in New Zealand were imported and identified during their isolation immediately after arrival. There are no hospitalized cases of COVID-19. The government has been seeking and evaluating candidate facilities to expand the capacity of government-managed isolation and quarantine. High-risk patients with respiratory illnesses are now included in the prioritized targets for COVID-19 testing. The clinical criteria for recovery from COVID-19 has been brought in line with Australian standards following a review, with 72 hours of no symptoms now needed for the case to be considered resolved (rather than 48). Pharmac, the national medicine-buying agency in New Zealand, has been seeking information from pharmaceutical companies about their plans to provide vaccines to New Zealanders, or if they plan to allow New Zealand to manufacture its own supply should a vaccine become available. The Prime Minister has outlined the governmentís plan to implement local lockdowns should community transmission return to New Zealand. The reopening of borders is not expected to proceed without significant epidemiological improvement in other jurisdictions. Since roughly 20% of children under 5 are not returning to early childhood centres after lockdown, many centres are struggling due to financial adversity.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although a couple of new cases were recorded among returnees in government-managed isolation, New Zealand has managed to maintain zero locally acquired cases for more than a month. The government is seeking ways to perform 4,000 tests per day at the border and encourage people to use the entry log system. To relieve the burden on managing returnees, a temporary hold has been put on new flight bookings, and those already booked will be admitted based on availability of quarantine facilities. Following two recent escapes from government-managed isolation, the government announced that there will be a constant police presence at every managed isolation and quarantine facility in New Zealand effective July 9. A massive privacy breach that published the personal details of recently confirmed cases is under investigation.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has had very few cases in the past few days, none of which were acquired locally. The Health Minister resigned on July 2 over personal lockdown breaches. A COVID-19 All-of-Government Response Group was established on July 1 under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to coordinate the future response to the pandemic, following the deactivation of the National Crisis Management Centre. Domestically, the testing criteria have been altered to prioritize people with symptoms who have had contact with overseas travellers or confirmed cases. The government-managed quarantine and isolation facilities will be increased from 24 to 27 this week as more Kiwis return to the country. The government is once again allowing people to leave government-managed quarantine earlier on compassionate grounds, under a tighter process. People are advised against overseas travel despite the European Unionís decision to reopen its borders to New Zealand travellers. The Prime Minister has suggested that those who choose to take non-essential international travel should be ready to bear the cost of their quarantine hotel stay upon return, while the co-payment scheme is still being discussed. The government also stated that it will remain cautious and has no plans to alter the existing border control measures. This comes despite an appeal to speed up border reopening by influential New Zealanders in the scientific community, the administration, and the business world. New Zealand has joined the global facility COVAX to co-invest in vaccine candidates and incentivize manufacturers to produce more.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 26, New Zealand has 14 active cases that were all imported and had been isolated upon arrival. Concerns arose over the loose observation of physical distancing and mask wearing on the flights bringing residents home. With growing anxiety over new infections and the arrival of the cold and flu season, testing centres across the country have been experiencing high demand--although many community assessment centres are already closed. Random testing is also being considered, especially among workers at airports or isolation hotels. The government is tightening rules at borders as more residents return. All people leaving government managed isolation facilities must now present a negative COVID-19 test. The housing minister was appointed to take control over isolation and quarantine management. Additionally, the opposition called for the health ministerís resignation over accusations that people have been able to leave quarantine without being tested. All isolation and quarantine facilities will be under inspection starting July. The government is seeking more isolation space at different facilities and a co-payment scheme is being considered for the quarantine hotel bills. Normal life continues domestically without restrictions. Some specified sports participants and infrastructure project workers are being permitted to enter New Zealand. The ban on cruise ships has been renewed. Crews from foreign boats (including cargo boats and other boats) that have been permitted entry are required to isolate, unless they have been on the ship for 28 continuous days without showing symptoms.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand ended its 24-day streak of zero new infections on June 16 after identifying two new cases from people who had been permitted to visit relatives who were on their deathbed. There is increasing concern about people returning from overseas and breaking quarantine rules. The contact tracing app has been upgraded to notify users about possible contact with confirmed cases. Hospitals have been busy dealing with postponed elective surgeries and increasing demand for normal emergency services. New Zealanders continue to enjoy their lives like normal while still being asked to stay vigilant. No legal requirements persist for businesses and services, but keeping entry logs by using QR codes is encouraged. Borders remain closed to foreign travellers and the opposition party has been urging the government to move faster in opening borders to tertiary international students, who make large contributions to New Zealand industries. The government granted entry last week to partners and dependents of New Zealand citizens and residents. Others with a compelling need will also be offered an entry exception.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With no active cases within its borders, New Zealand moved to a ìPrepareî alert level on midnight June 8. There have been no new cases for more than 2 weeks. Intensive testing will continue. Border controls will be enhanced to better handle imported cases. Beginning the week of June 8, anyone entering New Zealand has to be tested twice during their mandatory two-week quarantine. With physical distancing and mass gathering restrictions completely lifted, people can now return to their normal life despite the need to stay vigilant and practice good hygiene. Schools and workplaces are fully opened. Businesses and individuals are still recommended to keep track of those they come in contact with. Domestic transport can operate at full capacity with no restrictions. New Zealand borders remain closed to all foreign travellers, however, with the film industry returning to work, special permissions are granted to a limited number of foreign crew members.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has seen no new cases for 13 days in a row and no single case is still receiving hospital care. Dozens of community-based testing centres are closing around the country and people can be tested by general practitioners. Antibody testing is being conducted among high-risk populations in the Southern Region to reveal cases missed during swab testing. The opposition party is pressuring the government to move to the ìPrepareî alert level immediately.Most businesses have reopened with restrictions. Social gatherings can now be held with up to 100 people. Students at all ages have physically returned to school. The Prime Minister revealed the prospect of life under the ìPrepareî alert level as everyone having access to businesses and services without restrictions and limits on the maximum number of people attending gatherings. Cabinet will consider moving to the lower alert level on June 8. Still being precautious, the Prime Minister expects their borders to open to Australia by September.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New Zealand has experienced almost no new cases of COVID-19 as its last in-patient still receiving treatment for the virus is discharged from hospital. New Zealandís Health Ministry launched a new app providing information to medical professionals on May 27, while some district  health boards have refused to adopt the previous contact tracing app due to concerns over its functionality. Effective May 29, up to 100 people will be allowed to gather in public and private venues - a significant increase from the previous limit of 10. Health authorities have urged event organizers to keep a detailed record of gatherings and their attendees where possible. Employers are being encouraged to consider more flexible work arrangements, including remote work, and longer hours over fewer work days. Air New Zealand is maintaining a significantly reduced flight network until at least the of August. New Zealandís Prime Minister remains hesitant over opening exclusive travel routes with Australia, and expects that the trans-Tasman travel bubble will not come into being until at least the end of June. Restrictions are being reassessed every 2 weeks, and the country is expected to fully reopen by June 22.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 19, New Zealandís government released a contact tracing app that allows users to log the places they have recently visited. On May 13, a bill was passed - under intense scrutiny from the Opposition - that would allow New Zealandís Health Minister to legally enforce alert level rules after lifting the countryís state of emergency. Residents are now being allowed to visit stores, malls, cafÈs, restaurants, bars, and other public spaces. Contact records will no longer be a requirement for retailers. The number of people allowed to gather in one place has been limited to 10. Children are returning to school (with the attendance rate at about 80%), and early learning centers were allowed to open on May 18 - subject to strict physical distancing and hygiene rules. As both countries see promising trends in terms of control over the virus, New Zealand and Australia will proceed to establish a trans-Tasman travel ìbubbleî if deemed safe.</p>
