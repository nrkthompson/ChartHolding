      New Zealand ended its 24-day streak of zero new infections on June 16 after identifying two new cases from people who had been permitted to visit relatives who were on their deathbed. There is increasing concern about people returning from overseas and breaking quarantine rules. The contact tracing app has been upgraded to notify users about possible contact with confirmed cases. Hospitals have been busy dealing with postponed elective surgeries and increasing demand for normal emergency services. New Zealanders continue to enjoy their lives like normal while still being asked to stay vigilant. No legal requirements persist for businesses and services, but keeping entry logs by using QR codes is encouraged. Borders remain closed to foreign travellers and the opposition party has been urging the government to move faster in opening borders to tertiary international students, who make large contributions to New Zealand industries. The government granted entry last week to partners and dependents of New Zealand citizens and residents. Others with a compelling need will also be offered an entry exception.

      With no active cases within its borders, New Zealand moved to a “Prepare” alert level on midnight June 8. There have been no new cases for more than 2 weeks. Intensive testing will continue. Border controls will be enhanced to better handle imported cases. Beginning the week of June 8, anyone entering New Zealand has to be tested twice during their mandatory two-week quarantine. With physical distancing and mass gathering restrictions completely lifted, people can now return to their normal life despite the need to stay vigilant and practice good hygiene. Schools and workplaces are fully opened. Businesses and individuals are still recommended to keep track of those they come in contact with. Domestic transport can operate at full capacity with no restrictions. New Zealand borders remain closed to all foreign travellers, however, with the film industry returning to work, special permissions are granted to a limited number of foreign crew members.

      New Zealand has seen no new cases for 13 days in a row and no single case is still receiving hospital care. Dozens of community-based testing centres are closing around the country and people can be tested by general practitioners. Antibody testing is being conducted among high-risk populations in the Southern Region to reveal cases missed during swab testing. The opposition party is pressuring the government to move to the “Prepare” alert level immediately.Most businesses have reopened with restrictions. Social gatherings can now be held with up to 100 people. Students at all ages have physically returned to school. The Prime Minister revealed the prospect of life under the “Prepare” alert level as everyone having access to businesses and services without restrictions and limits on the maximum number of people attending gatherings. Cabinet will consider moving to the lower alert level on June 8. Still being precautious, the Prime Minister expects their borders to open to Australia by September.

      New Zealand has experienced almost no new cases of COVID-19 as its last in-patient still receiving treatment for the virus is discharged from hospital. New Zealand’s Health Ministry launched a new app providing information to medical professionals on May 27, while some district  health boards have refused to adopt the previous contact tracing app due to concerns over its functionality. Effective May 29, up to 100 people will be allowed to gather in public and private venues - a significant increase from the previous limit of 10. Health authorities have urged event organizers to keep a detailed record of gatherings and their attendees where possible. Employers are being encouraged to consider more flexible work arrangements, including remote work, and longer hours over fewer work days. Air New Zealand is maintaining a significantly reduced flight network until at least the of August. New Zealand’s Prime Minister remains hesitant over opening exclusive travel routes with Australia, and expects that the trans-Tasman travel bubble will not come into being until at least the end of June. Restrictions are being reassessed every 2 weeks, and the country is expected to fully reopen by June 22.

      On May 19, New Zealand’s government released a contact tracing app that allows users to log the places they have recently visited. On May 13, a bill was passed - under intense scrutiny from the Opposition - that would allow New Zealand’s Health Minister to legally enforce alert level rules after lifting the country’s state of emergency. Residents are now being allowed to visit stores, malls, cafés, restaurants, bars, and other public spaces. Contact records will no longer be a requirement for retailers. The number of people allowed to gather in one place has been limited to 10. Children are returning to school (with the attendance rate at about 80%), and early learning centers were allowed to open on May 18 - subject to strict physical distancing and hygiene rules. As both countries see promising trends in terms of control over the virus, New Zealand and Australia will proceed to establish a trans-Tasman travel “bubble” if deemed safe.
