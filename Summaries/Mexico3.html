      On June 3, Mexico revealed its highest daily death toll  at 1092. On May 28, May 29 and June 2, Mexico received ventilators and PPE from the US and China. To expand their testing rate, 114 more clinics and hospitals will conduct tests and implement contact tracing techniques. On June 1, Mexico entered their final stage of reopening and implemented a traffic light system to reopen social, school and economic activities varying by region. Federal and regional governments will collaborate to determine regional reopening. Masks and social distancing are required in public. Parts of the mining, construction, auto parts, tourism, equipment manufacturing, public markets, public parks, businesses and beer production sectors resumed with restrictions. Reopening is restricted in areas with high numbers of cases, which government maps reflect as most of the country. On August 10, three week long remedial schools begin in person in regions of Mexico classified as fully open. Elementary schools will resume during the first week of September, and middle and upper level schools will resume in person on September 21 with health restrictions. Mexican experts concur with the stoplight system, but disagree with the timing and suggest that the country has not plateaued and that restrictions should ease after a two week decline of cases. Experts advocate for more testing and different health measures for public transport. Caravan protests in 40 cities called for President Lopez-Obradorâ€™s resignation; the president responded by reminding protestors of opportunities in 2021 and 2022 to remove him from office before his mandate ends in 2024.
