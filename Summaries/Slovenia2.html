      Kindergartens, primary schools for grades 1-3, and secondary schools for final year students have resumed, with the majority of eligible students being reported as having returned to school. All restaurants and stores are open but theatres across Slovenia remain closed. It is expected that theatres will be preparing to reopen with rehearsals in the coming weeks but are calling on the government to provide safety guidelines and an official timeline. With a phase reopening to neighbouring countries likely in the coming weeks, 17 news exemptions to the 14 day quarantine requirement for EU and Schengen zone nationals came into effect on May 26. Now, EU citizens can enter as tourists as long as they meet one of the exemptions. Exemptions include confirmation of booking, owning property, and commuting to work. In efforts to prevent another lockdown in the Fall, the Head of the Health Ministry Advisory Task Force, Bojana Beovic, said government efforts should be directed at testing and contact tracing to try to prepare for and delay a second wave. Efforts will also focus on mitigating staffing shortages by training additional essential personnel.
