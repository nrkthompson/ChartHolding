      Latvia’s nationwide state of emergency will remain in effect until at least June 9th, but many of its strict measures are gradually being relaxed. Gatherings of up to 25 people have been allowed since May 7th, provided that individuals are able to maintain at least 2 metres of distance between each other. Latvia’s Minister of Health has said that after June 9th, this limit could be increased to 50 for indoor gatherings, and possibly up to 200 for outdoor gatherings. Religious services are being allowed to take place subject to sanitary protocols, while weddings, baptisms, and funerals can be organized with up to 25 guests.  Despite extending its state of emergency, a meeting of the Latvian government on May 21st decided that citizens and permanent residents of the EU and Switzerland will be allowed to enter and leave the Republic of Latvia, effectively immediately. Arrivals are still required to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry. Latvia’s state of emergency has been extended twice since it was first announced on March 13th; Prime Minister Krišj?nis Kari?š has said that the latest extension is likely to be the last one.
