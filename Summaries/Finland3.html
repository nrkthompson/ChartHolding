      All restrictions on domestic leisure travel were lifted this week as the school year came to an end in Finland. The limits were lifted despite public health officials warning that domestic leisure travel should be strongly discouraged just a few days prior to the announcement. Significant restrictions on eateries, entertainment and gatherings were removed on June 1, with much of Finnish society now reopen. While normal public and private gatherings are now limited to 50 people (previous limit was 10), some mass events of up to 500 people will be permitted if the organizers commit to following social distancing protocols. The government will continue to discuss its coronavirus exit strategy with opposition parties, with the next update expected before June 21. Finland plans to launch its voluntary coronavirus tracing app in August, though the government has said that it will not replace traditional tracing methods conducted by local governments. The government plans to amend its Basic Education Act to allow for more flexibility in moving between in-person schooling and remote learning methods. The amendment would allow for regional variation and temporary changes to learning plans if the pandemic worsens in the next school year.
