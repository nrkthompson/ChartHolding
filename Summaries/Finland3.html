      The reopening of borders on June 15 will go ahead as scheduled after the government stated last week that it was still attempting to figure out testing protocols for tourists. Tourists who do not wish to quarantine upon arrival will need to present a negative PCR test from the four days prior to arrival or a positive PCR test that is more than 14 days old. Nurses in Iceland are voting on strike action this week after working without a contract for more than a year. If approved, the strike is scheduled to begin on June 22 and will affect 2500 nurses at all public healthcare clinics just one week after borders to the country reopen.
