  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 678 new cases of COVID-19 on September 25, the country’s largest daily increase in new cases since the beginning of the pandemic. This is the second time in the past two weeks that the country has set a new record for daily cases. The Danish government has extended a late-night assembly ban on a popular nightlife area in Copenhagen until the end of the month. While bars in the area must close at 10pm, the government is hoping to avoid the occurrence of any spontaneous gatherings in the area. The gathering ban only applies between 10pm and 2am each night. Denmark has advised against all non-essential travel to the United Kingdom and Ireland, effective September 26. Travellers from those countries arriving in Denmark must quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival. A technical error with Smittestopp, Denmark’s contact tracing app, may have caused some users to not receive a notification that they have been in contact with an infected person, and it is not known whether the error has been in place since the app launched in June.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 589 new cases of COVID-19 on September 19, the countryís largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. Testing has vastly increased since March, but officials remain worried about the rising rate of infection. New cases are spread throughout the country, with 84 of Denmarkís 98 municipalities reporting at least one case in the past week. Due to the rising number of active cases, the Danish government announced a number of new restrictions set to take effect nationwide. Bars and restaurants across the country must close at 10 pm, and all guests who are not at their table must wear a mask. The gathering limit has been reduced to 50 people, though exceptions remain for some seated events. Denmark has also recommended that residents who can work from home do so and that those who cannot should avoid public transit during peak hours. All of these restrictions were already in place in the Copenhagen area, but were implemented nationally due to the rising infection rate outside the capital region. The restrictions are set to last until at least October 4. Denmarkís infectious diseases agency has recommended that residents avoid contact with people outside a ësocial bubbleí of 5 to 10 people and should avoid socializing entirely if they can. Parents will be able to receive up to 10 days of parental benefits from the government if their child is sent home from school due to COVID-19 -- effective October 1. The Danish government is advising against non-essential travel to Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Portugal due to a rising infection rate in those countries. They are also likely to add the UK and Iceland to this list in the coming days.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark registered 179 new cases of COVID-19 on September 3 in the countryís highest daily increase since April. Many of the new cases are linked to a teacher training college, which has since switched to remote learning while more than 1000 students and staff are self-isolating. In response to the new outbreaks, restrictions have been reintroduced in the Copenhagen area. The private gathering limit has been reduced from 100 to 50 people, and no fans will be allowed at any sporting events. All eateries in Copenhagen must close by midnight, and social activities connected to schools must be cancelled. Public sector employees in the region will return to working from home for at least the next two weeks. The Danish government has advised against travel to France and Croatia as both countries experience a resurgence in new cases. Testing capacity at the Copenhagen Airport will be doubled in the coming days, and new testing centres will be set up throughout the capital region. Despite the concerning rise in cases, a new poll showed that the Danish government has among the highest approval ratings in the world concerning its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A number of measures introduced to contain the spread of the outbreak in Aarhus have been extended until September 4. The measures include a recommendation to work from home, avoid crowded public places, and use distance learning when possible. Although the situation in the city has improved, authorities warned residents of high infection rates. 71 new infections were reported in Denmark on August 21, the countryís lowest daily increase since new outbreaks began at the beginning of August. Public health officials said that while the decline is encouraging, infections have been largely stable for the past two weeks. As demand for testing in Denmark has grown, wait times have been reported to be as much as a few days in some areas. Opposition parties expressed concern to the Minister of Health, who said that the government was working to increase testing capacity as soon as possible.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark will mandate the application of face masks on public transit across the entire country on August 22, due to the recent surge in cases. Mandatory mask policies on public transit had previously been implemented in seven Danish cities in response to the outbreak in Aarhus. Despite the rising infection rate, the government announced that it was moving ahead with Phase 4 of its reopening plan. Under this phase, Denmark plans to abolish the requirement that foreign tourists spending at least six nights in the country.  It will also allow bars and restaurants to remain open until 2 am. However, a planned expansion of the private gathering limit to 200 and plans to reopen nightclubs were both pushed back to the next phase, which is scheduled to begin on October 31. Denmark will perform random antibody testing on tens of thousands of residents in an attempt to monitor the true spread of COVID-19. The second quarter of this year saw Denmarkís GDP experience its largest quarterly drop since the early 1990s, when the country began keeping quarterly records of economic data.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 169 new cases of COVID-19 on August 8, the countryís largest daily increase since April 25. Much of the growth in new cases has been driven by outbreaks at a meat processing plant in Ringsted and in Aarhus, Denmarkís second largest city. In response to the outbreak, face masks are now mandatory on public transit in Aarhus. The government has indicated that it may extend this rule to other cities if outbreaks continue. PM Fredericksen urged Danes to maintain social distancing in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 and said that a planned expansion of the private gathering limit from 100 to 200 people would be postponed. The government plans to meet on August 12 to discuss any further reopening, with delays expected for certain aspects of nightlife. Fredericksen said that the government was willing to implement a mandatory mask policy if the infection rate continues to rise. The Danish Foreign Ministry advised against non-essential travel to Spain and Andorra due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in those countries.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 91 new cases of COVID-19 on July 30 in the countryís largest daily increase since May 18. Officials have stressed that one day of data is not concerning, and stated that Denmarkís case numbers are still stable and hospitalizations are going down. A significant proportion of the new cases are connected to an outbreak at a meat processing plant in Ringsted. The plant has since shut down much of its operations and is operating at half-capacity. The Danish Health Agency has recommended that face masks be used on public transit when social distancing is not possible. Danish officials had previously resisted recommending the use of face masks, but rising infection levels in Denmark led to the change in policy. Denmark lifted all travel restrictions on Sweden on August 1, allowing residents of all regions to travel to Denmark for tourism if they have booked accommodation for at least six nights. The residents of several regions in Sweden were already able to travel to Denmark after reporting an infection rate below 20 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of confirmed cases in Denmark has risen sharply over the past two weeks, with 240 new cases diagnosed in the week of July 13 to July 20. However, the Health Minister said that this rise in infections did not necessarily mean there is a major outbreak, and continued to emphasize hygiene and social distancing regulations. Critics have argued that a mandatory mask policy similar to other EU countries could help prevent further spread, but the government has been hesitant to implement such a policy. Bulgaria was added to the list of countries to which non-essential travel is unauthorized, joining Luxembourg, Portugal, and Sweden. Travel restrictions for five additional regions in Sweden were relaxed.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Danish government eased travel restrictions on three more counties in Sweden (Halland, Kalmar and V‰rmland), and is allowing travellers from Georgia, Uruguay, and Tunisia to enter the country. Denmark is still recommending against unnecessary travel to Georgia and Uruguay due to their quarantine requirements for arriving Danish citizens. The Ministry of Health is encouraging more Danes to download the countryís contact tracing app after it successfully warned 4 people of their potential exposure to COVID-19. Around 745,000 people have downloaded the app, and the Ministry hopes to reach a million downloads soon. Higher passenger traffic at the Copenhagen Airport has caused its testing centre to expand its operating hours and number of testing stations from two to eight. Testing at the airport is still offered free of charge to arriving passengers.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Danish government raised its private gathering limit to 100 people on July 8, allowing larger meetings, conferences, and parties to take place. Some larger public events, including games in the Danish Superliga, have already been permitted to take place with as many as 10,500 people. The private gathering limit will be raised to 200 people on August 8 if there is no associated surge in cases. The Danish Health Agency dropped its opposition to the use of face masks in certain circumstances, recommending the use if a person has to leave self-isolation, is visiting an elderly relative, or is returning from abroad. Public health officials had previously been concerned that their stockpile of masks would run out if they recommended use by the general public. Residents of four Swedish counties on the Danish border may now enter Denmark for leisure travel after they met the criteria for unrestricted entry. All travellers from Sweden must carry documents that confirm their residency in one of the eligible counties.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After the EU offered a list of 15 countries that the continental bloc considered safe for entry into the Schengen Area, Denmark said that they would allow non-essential entry to only six of them: Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Thailand. While the government said the other countries on the EUís list were not safe enough for entry into Denmark, the government did not reveal why. Travellers from permitted countries will likely have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival, as Danish travellers are required to do the same in those countries. The Danish government is still strongly recommending against travelling to these countries unless necessary. The final month of the Danish Superliga season will be played in front of up to 10,500 fans, depending on stadium capacity. After three successful test matches with 3,000 fans, the government decided that there is minimal risk of infection and up to 500 fans will be allowed in each section of a teamís stadium--as long as physical distancing is maintained. However, a recent match had to be stopped for nearly 20 minutes after fans of both clubs refused to abide by the physical distancing rules; 50 fans were expelled from the stadium.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 25, Denmark opened its borders to tourists from all but six EU/EEA countries:  the exceptions being UK, Sweden, Portugal, Malta, Romania, and Ireland). While only Sweden and the UK are currently ineligible based on the criteria outlined the previous week, the other countries are barred due to restrictions they have imposed on Danish tourists. University students and staff were allowed to return to campus on June 22 to write their final exams and prepare for the fall semester. International students will be permitted to enter the country for the upcoming semester, as education programs have been deemed essential activities. Professional sports teams are now allowed to have fans in attendance at their games, though with limited capacity and social distancing rules applied. While the normal limit for gatherings in Denmark is 500 people, the games are granted an exemption of up to 3000 people. The government has said it will consider allowing more than 3000 people at the games if the infection rate in the country remains low.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A few days after the initial opening of its border to tourists from Norway, Iceland and Germany, Denmark announced that it will open its border to tourists from most European countries on June 27. Eligibility is granted if a country has fewer than 20 cases per 100,000 people over the preceding week. If a countryís infection rate rises to 30 cases per 100,000 people, then tourists will need to quarantine on arrival. Tourists need to show that they have booked accommodation for at least six nights before entering the country. Nordic countries will be assessed on a regional basis, which means residents of certain Swedish regions will be able to enter Denmark even as the countryís infection rate as a whole remains high. Border restrictions with all other countries are currently set to expire on August 31. A town with a large elderly population reported 34 new cases over last weekend in the countryís first major outbreak since the gradual lifting of restrictions began in May. The outbreak is linked to a single long-term care home, but has since spread to two different schools in the town. The Minister of Health said that the outbreak should be taken as a warning to Danes who feel that Denmark is now insulated from the virus.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark lifted a number of restrictions this week as the country moves towards a full reopening of its economy. The gathering limit increased to 50 people, and fitness centres and swimming pools could reopen on June 8. Some events of up to 500 people may be allowed under an as-of-yet unreleased set of guidelines, including weddings and sports events. While these events may be permitted to occur, they must follow the guidelines set out for nightlife, meaning they must end by midnight and limit alcohol sales. Opposition parties railed against this policy, saying that the government was treating Danish citizens like children. The government later reached an agreement with opposition parties to raise the gathering limit to 100 people on July 8 and 200 people on August 8, however, there is no timeline for the other restrictions still in place. The government is advising that the 15,000 people who took part in an anti-racism protest in Copenhagen this week be tested for COVID-19 due to fears of a mass spread of the virus. PM Frederiksen has conceded that her decision to lockdown Denmark in March was largely political after facing criticism that she ignored the advice of public health officials in the early days of the crisis.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, the Foreign Minister of Denmark announced that Danes who travel to Iceland, Norway or Germany may return without self-isolating as long as they did not visit cities with populations larger than 750,000. Since Iceland and Norway do not have cities of that size, this restriction only applies to arrivals from Germany. Although travel advisories regarding all other countries are a recommendation and are not mandatory, they are expected to remain in place until August 31. Tourists from Iceland, Norway and Germany will be allowed into Denmark if they show proof that they have lodging booked for a minimum six night stay outside of Copenhagen and will be randomly asked to submit to an optional COVID-19 test. New guidelines on gatherings are expected to be released next week and anticipated to permit gatherings with 30-50 people. Opposition parties are pushing for the higher end of the spectrum to allow for more events.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Scandinavian airline SAS, of which the Danish state is a major shareholder, is resuming a number of domestic and international flights this week after laying off nearly half of its workforce in April. Aircrafts will operate at a reduced capacity, though increasing the number of routes has doubled the number of planes needed to service passengers. Denmark and Norway have reached an agreement to open their border to each otherís tourists from June 15th, in a deal that excludes Sweden despite Swedish diplomatic pressure to open all Nordic nations at once. PM Frederiksen has been accused of lying to the Danish people in her initial announcement of lockdown restrictions by saying that the measures taken had been approved by state agencies. Records from the Public Health and Infectious Diseases agencies indicate that they did not recommend the strict restrictions that were implemented, and had even advised against some of them in the weeks prior to the announcement.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Negotiations between the Danish government and opposition parties have been ongoing for the past few weeks as Denmark aims to gradually return to normal lie. As part of its plan, Denmark has announced that all Danish adults will have the opportunity to be tested for coronavirus, including those who have no symptoms. While the program will only be open to 18-to-25 year olds initially, it will gradually be expanded to all age groups in the coming months. A clarification on the age range was issued after tens of thousands of Danes attempted to make an appointment on the governmentís online service, only to be told they were ineligible. Denmarkís virus reproduction rate has remained below 1 since its initial stage of reopening, staying between 0.6 and 0.9 even as restrictions have loosened. The government and opposition came to an agreement that moved up some aspects of the reopening plan, allowing cultural institutions to open on May 21st and expanding the list of reasons a foreigner could enter Denmark to allow for visiting relatives and checking on second homes (only available to Nordic residents and Germans). The government has promised to release a plan for the tourism industry by May 29th after business leaders and members of the opposition have criticized the lack of clarity over border controls.</p>
