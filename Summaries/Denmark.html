  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Danish government raised its private gathering limit to 100 people on July 8, allowing larger meetings, conferences, and parties to take place. Some larger public events, including games in the Danish Superliga, have already been permitted to take place with as many as 10,500 people. The private gathering limit will be raised to 200 people on August 8 if there is no associated surge in cases. The Danish Health Agency dropped its opposition to the use of face masks in certain circumstances, recommending the use if a person has to leave self-isolation, is visiting an elderly relative, or is returning from abroad. Public health officials had previously been concerned that their stockpile of masks would run out if they recommended use by the general public. Residents of four Swedish counties on the Danish border may now enter Denmark for leisure travel after they met the criteria for unrestricted entry. All travellers from Sweden must carry documents that confirm their residency in one of the eligible counties.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After the EU offered a list of 15 countries that the continental bloc considered safe for entry into the Schengen Area, Denmark said that they would allow non-essential entry to only six of them: Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Thailand. While the government said the other countries on the EU’s list were not safe enough for entry into Denmark, the government did not reveal why. Travellers from permitted countries will likely have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival, as Danish travellers are required to do the same in those countries. The Danish government is still strongly recommending against travelling to these countries unless necessary. The final month of the Danish Superliga season will be played in front of up to 10,500 fans, depending on stadium capacity. After three successful test matches with 3,000 fans, the government decided that there is minimal risk of infection and up to 500 fans will be allowed in each section of a team’s stadium--as long as physical distancing is maintained. However, a recent match had to be stopped for nearly 20 minutes after fans of both clubs refused to abide by the physical distancing rules; 50 fans were expelled from the stadium.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 25, Denmark opened its borders to tourists from all but six EU/EEA countries:  the exceptions being UK, Sweden, Portugal, Malta, Romania, and Ireland). While only Sweden and the UK are currently ineligible based on the criteria outlined the previous week, the other countries are barred due to restrictions they have imposed on Danish tourists. University students and staff were allowed to return to campus on June 22 to write their final exams and prepare for the fall semester. International students will be permitted to enter the country for the upcoming semester, as education programs have been deemed essential activities. Professional sports teams are now allowed to have fans in attendance at their games, though with limited capacity and social distancing rules applied. While the normal limit for gatherings in Denmark is 500 people, the games are granted an exemption of up to 3000 people. The government has said it will consider allowing more than 3000 people at the games if the infection rate in the country remains low.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A few days after the initial opening of its border to tourists from Norway, Iceland and Germany, Denmark announced that it will open its border to tourists from most European countries on June 27. Eligibility is granted if a country has fewer than 20 cases per 100,000 people over the preceding week. If a country’s infection rate rises to 30 cases per 100,000 people, then tourists will need to quarantine on arrival. Tourists need to show that they have booked accommodation for at least six nights before entering the country. Nordic countries will be assessed on a regional basis, which means residents of certain Swedish regions will be able to enter Denmark even as the country’s infection rate as a whole remains high. Border restrictions with all other countries are currently set to expire on August 31. A town with a large elderly population reported 34 new cases over last weekend in the country’s first major outbreak since the gradual lifting of restrictions began in May. The outbreak is linked to a single long-term care home, but has since spread to two different schools in the town. The Minister of Health said that the outbreak should be taken as a warning to Danes who feel that Denmark is now insulated from the virus.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark lifted a number of restrictions this week as the country moves towards a full reopening of its economy. The gathering limit increased to 50 people, and fitness centres and swimming pools could reopen on June 8. Some events of up to 500 people may be allowed under an as-of-yet unreleased set of guidelines, including weddings and sports events. While these events may be permitted to occur, they must follow the guidelines set out for nightlife, meaning they must end by midnight and limit alcohol sales. Opposition parties railed against this policy, saying that the government was treating Danish citizens like children. The government later reached an agreement with opposition parties to raise the gathering limit to 100 people on July 8 and 200 people on August 8, however, there is no timeline for the other restrictions still in place. The government is advising that the 15,000 people who took part in an anti-racism protest in Copenhagen this week be tested for COVID-19 due to fears of a mass spread of the virus. PM Frederiksen has conceded that her decision to lockdown Denmark in March was largely political after facing criticism that she ignored the advice of public health officials in the early days of the crisis.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, the Foreign Minister of Denmark announced that Danes who travel to Iceland, Norway or Germany may return without self-isolating as long as they did not visit cities with populations larger than 750,000. Since Iceland and Norway do not have cities of that size, this restriction only applies to arrivals from Germany. Although travel advisories regarding all other countries are a recommendation and are not mandatory, they are expected to remain in place until August 31. Tourists from Iceland, Norway and Germany will be allowed into Denmark if they show proof that they have lodging booked for a minimum six night stay outside of Copenhagen and will be randomly asked to submit to an optional COVID-19 test. New guidelines on gatherings are expected to be released next week and anticipated to permit gatherings with 30-50 people. Opposition parties are pushing for the higher end of the spectrum to allow for more events.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Scandinavian airline SAS, of which the Danish state is a major shareholder, is resuming a number of domestic and international flights this week after laying off nearly half of its workforce in April. Aircrafts will operate at a reduced capacity, though increasing the number of routes has doubled the number of planes needed to service passengers. Denmark and Norway have reached an agreement to open their border to each other’s tourists from June 15th, in a deal that excludes Sweden despite Swedish diplomatic pressure to open all Nordic nations at once. PM Frederiksen has been accused of lying to the Danish people in her initial announcement of lockdown restrictions by saying that the measures taken had been approved by state agencies. Records from the Public Health and Infectious Diseases agencies indicate that they did not recommend the strict restrictions that were implemented, and had even advised against some of them in the weeks prior to the announcement.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Negotiations between the Danish government and opposition parties have been ongoing for the past few weeks as Denmark aims to gradually return to normal lie. As part of its plan, Denmark has announced that all Danish adults will have the opportunity to be tested for coronavirus, including those who have no symptoms. While the program will only be open to 18-to-25 year olds initially, it will gradually be expanded to all age groups in the coming months. A clarification on the age range was issued after tens of thousands of Danes attempted to make an appointment on the government’s online service, only to be told they were ineligible. Denmark’s virus reproduction rate has remained below 1 since its initial stage of reopening, staying between 0.6 and 0.9 even as restrictions have loosened. The government and opposition came to an agreement that moved up some aspects of the reopening plan, allowing cultural institutions to open on May 21st and expanding the list of reasons a foreigner could enter Denmark to allow for visiting relatives and checking on second homes (only available to Nordic residents and Germans). The government has promised to release a plan for the tourism industry by May 29th after business leaders and members of the opposition have criticized the lack of clarity over border controls.</p>
