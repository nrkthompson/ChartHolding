  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The epidemiological situation in Denmark has rapidly improved, with the country reporting its lowest daily case numbers since October. On January 19, the positivity rate of testing was below 1% nationally and the estimated R0 number was 0.6. However, the prime minister said that the government was likely to extend their lockdown measures further. On January 22, Denmark imposed a ban on incoming flights from the United Arab Emirates due to suspicions that their pre-flight testing regime is unreliable. The ban is in effect for at least five days while the issue is investigated. All incoming air travellers must produce a negative COVID-19 test from no more than three days prior to their arrival in Denmark. The ban on public use of the Christiania area of Copenhagen will continue until at least January 27, with violators facing a fine of up to 2,500 kroner. The government will receive 100,000 fewer doses of the Pfizer vaccine than it was expecting due to production delays. Denmark has vaccinated over 3% of its total population, among the highest rates in the EU.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The epidemiological situation in Denmark has been improving over the past several weeks, with just 659 new infections reported on January 16 -- the lowest number in nearly three months. Despite the encouraging decline in case numbers, the government has extended its lockdown measures by another two weeks to February 7. All travel restrictions have also been extended, with the government urging residents to avoid all international travel. People attempting to enter Denmark through a land border with Germany may be able to access a rapid test where a negative result would give them access to the country. The travellers would then need to take a PCR test when they reach their destination in Denmark, which they can use for re-entry for up to a week. Over 2% of the Danish population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, by far the highest rate in the EU. The government said they would have vaccinated an even greater proportion of the population if they did not run out of their vaccine supply.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 4,508 new cases of COVID-19 on December 18 in the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The Danish government extended its partial lockdown measures to all municipalities in the country on December 16, with all eateries moving to takeout and delivery only, all cultural venues closed, and all leisure activities prohibited. Denmark will progress into a full lockdown by Christmas. All shopping centres were forced to close on December 17. All personal care services and schools shut their doors on December 21 and all other non-essential stores will be closed from December 25 until at least January 3. The government said that there are no plans to implement domestic travel restrictions but is strongly recommending that all Danes see no more than 10 people socially. Denmark has banned flights from the UK for at least 48 hours due to the discovery of a new highly infectious strain of COVID-19. Denmark is set to begin vaccinating its residents on December 27, and potentially earlier if doses have arrived in the country.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 3,552 new cases of COVID-19 on December 10 in the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. Thirty-one more municipalities have been placed under the partial lockdown order announced last week. The restrictions now cover 79% of the Danish population. Only 29 municipalities are unaffected by the restrictions, which close most cultural venues and leisure activities and send students in grade 5 and up to distance learning. The restrictions will remain in place until at least January 3. Authorities are strongly encouraging Danish residents to limit their social contacts during the holiday season but have said they will not introduce domestic travel restrictions between communities under lockdown and those that are not. Residents of Aarhus and Copenhagen need to wait as long as 12 days to get tested for COVID-19 if they are asymptomatic or report only mild symptoms.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 1,745 new cases of COVID-19 on December 6 -- the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. Hospitalizations are expected to increase significantly over the next week. On December 9, a partial lockdown will be put in place in 38 municipalities across Denmark, including Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Odense. Restaurants and bars can only offer takeout services. All leisure activities and cultural venues must close, though professional sport is exempted from the restrictions. All schools for those in grades 5 and up will move to distance learning, including universities and adult education. All public sector workers will work from home. The nationwide gathering limit of 10 people, restrictions on alcohol sales, and mask requirements have been extended until the end of February. Local officials had previously introduced stricter restrictions in Copenhagen.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new cases reported in Denmark has remained relatively stable over the past week, though officials expect another surge in cases as the holiday season approaches. The government is asking all residents of West Jutland to get tested after a number of cases were linked to mink farm workers. None of the infected persons were found to have the mutated strain of COVID-19, but officials are advising enhanced testing protocols as a precaution. Local officials in the Copenhagen region are expected to announce new restrictions covering the retail sector this week. The ministry of health is developing a Ôvaccine passportÕ for Danish residents that may be used to permit access to large events throughout the country. Denmark has announced its vaccination plan. The first Danish residents are scheduled to receive the vaccine as early as December. The elderly, at-risk groups, and healthcare workers will be given priority access before it is made available to the general public.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 1,257 new cases of COVID-19 on November 20, the countryÕs fourth consecutive day with more than 1,200 cases. The government announced that it believed that the mutated form of COVID-19 found in minks has been Òmost likely eradicatedÓ after euthanizing most of the animals in the country. The announcement came two days after the government reached an agreement on a legal framework for the cull, which also banned mink farming until at least 2022. Restrictions were lifted on the North Jutland region two weeks ahead of schedule on November 20, with eateries allowed to reopen, public transit operating normally, and students allowed to return to school. Mass testing of 73,000 people in the region did not find any cases related to the mutation. Denmark will shift to a regional model in its travel advisories for all European countries, and will shorten its quarantine period for incoming travellers to 10 days. The quarantine can be shortened further if the individual produces a negative test result after four days. The public gathering limit of 10 people has been extended until December 13.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of hospitalized patients in Denmark has reached 243, the most in more than six months. The government is facing mounting pressure over its decision to cull all of the countryÕs minks due to a mutated strain of COVID-19 after it was revealed that the government did not have the legal authority to issue the order in most areas. Authorities have issued an apology to fur farmers for not specifying that the euthanization was a recommendation, not a legal mandate. Some prominent Danish virologists are questioning data indicating that the mutation would affect the efficacy of a future vaccine -- indicating that, while the strain is less sensitive to antibodies than other variants, there is limited evidence to suggest that a vaccine would be completely ineffective against it. Negotiations with opposition parties are ongoing over a legal framework for a compensation package for mink-fur farmers.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 1,427 new cases of COVID-19 on November 7 in the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. This is the third consecutive week that Denmark has experienced its largest number of daily new cases. The government announced that it planned to cull all of the countryÕs nearly 17 million minks after a mutated strain of COVID-19 found in the animals has since spread to humans. The prime minister said that the mutation poses significant risks for the efficacy of a future vaccine and that the euthanization was necessary. However, talks with opposition parties regarding the plan have since stalled after they characterized the plan as an overreaction. Due to a high concentration of mink farms in the region, the government has asked residents of North Jutland not to leave their home municipalities and has closed all restaurants, bars, leisure and cultural activities, and public transit. Most schools in the area have moved to online learning. Public health officials are preparing to perform mass testing of the entire population of the region.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 1,191 new cases of COVID-19 on October 30 in the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. There was a record-high level of testing conducted on the same day, with a positivity rate of 1.7%. There are 144 hospitalizations in the country as of October 30, and the worst affected areas are in the Copenhagen region. The prime minister has said that the government is willing to implement further restrictions if the infection rate does not fall following the introduction of new restrictions last week.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 859 new cases of COVID-19 on October 23 in the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. It was the second straight day that Denmark set a record for its largest daily increase. The government introduced a number of new restrictions. Masks must be worn at all indoor public places, the sale of alcohol will be banned after 10pm, and the gathering limit will be lowered to 10 people. The restrictions will be in place until at least January 2. Additionally, all travelers from high-risk countries will be required to present a negative COVID-19 test result from the previous three days upon their arrival. The policy applies to all work and family-related travel. Only Estonia, Greece, and Norway are not currently considered to be high-risk. The requirement for people with mild symptoms of COVID-19 to get a referral from their doctor for a test has been removed.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new cases and hospitalizations has remained largely stable over the past week. No new restrictions have been implemented, though current restrictions are expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future, however, the health minister has expressed concern after the amount of testing has dropped considerably over the past few weeks, leading to a higher positivity rate. Up to 1.5 million minks in Denmark may be euthanized due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 among animal farms in the country. Public health officials are concerned that a mutated form of COVID-19 found in minks may be vaccine-resistant.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 290 new cases on October 13, the lowest daily increase in over a month. The health minister said that the countryÕs R0 number is below 1 for the first time since the last week of August. Despite the falling infection rate, the Danish government extended all of its current COVID-19 restrictions until October 31. The private gathering limit remains at 50 people, cafes and bars must close by 10pm, and masks are mandatory on public transit. The ministry of foreign affairs advised against non-essential travel to eight Swedish regions, including Stockholm, due to a rising infection rate. During the opening session of the Danish parliament, the prime minister said that the government would develop a COVID-19 warning system that would enable them to respond quickly and predictably to clusters of outbreaks.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The director of the Danish Health Authority has advised all those who experience even minor symptoms of an illness to stay home from work, reminding Danes that anyone who has had close contact with an infected person or has travelled to a high-risk country should self-isolate. The reproduction rate in Denmark is currently estimated to be 1.1, having fallen from between 1.3 and 1.5 in the past week. The restrictions on nightlife and assemblies implemented in Copenhagen last week have been extended two weeks. They are now set to expire on October 18. A technical error at the Danish Health Data Authority has caused the mass deletion of thousands of emails sent by staff at SSI, the countryÕs infectious diseases agency. The error may prevent access to the decision-making process during the countryÕs response to the pandemic, which would normally be ensured under DenmarkÕs freedom of information laws.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 678 new cases of COVID-19 on September 25, the countryÕs largest daily increase in new cases since the beginning of the pandemic. This is the second time in the past two weeks that the country has set a new record for daily cases. The Danish government has extended a late-night assembly ban on a popular nightlife area in Copenhagen until the end of the month. While bars in the area must close at 10pm, the government is hoping to avoid the occurrence of any spontaneous gatherings in the area. The gathering ban only applies between 10pm and 2am each night. Denmark has advised against all non-essential travel to the United Kingdom and Ireland, effective September 26. Travellers from those countries arriving in Denmark must quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival. A technical error with Smittestopp, DenmarkÕs contact tracing app, may have caused some users to not receive a notification that they have been in contact with an infected person, and it is not known whether the error has been in place since the app launched in June.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 589 new cases of COVID-19 on September 19, the country’s largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. Testing has vastly increased since March, but officials remain worried about the rising rate of infection. New cases are spread throughout the country, with 84 of Denmark’s 98 municipalities reporting at least one case in the past week. Due to the rising number of active cases, the Danish government announced a number of new restrictions set to take effect nationwide. Bars and restaurants across the country must close at 10 pm, and all guests who are not at their table must wear a mask. The gathering limit has been reduced to 50 people, though exceptions remain for some seated events. Denmark has also recommended that residents who can work from home do so and that those who cannot should avoid public transit during peak hours. All of these restrictions were already in place in the Copenhagen area, but were implemented nationally due to the rising infection rate outside the capital region. The restrictions are set to last until at least October 4. Denmark’s infectious diseases agency has recommended that residents avoid contact with people outside a ‘social bubble’ of 5 to 10 people and should avoid socializing entirely if they can. Parents will be able to receive up to 10 days of parental benefits from the government if their child is sent home from school due to COVID-19 -- effective October 1. The Danish government is advising against non-essential travel to Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Portugal due to a rising infection rate in those countries. They are also likely to add the UK and Iceland to this list in the coming days.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark registered 179 new cases of COVID-19 on September 3 in the country’s highest daily increase since April. Many of the new cases are linked to a teacher training college, which has since switched to remote learning while more than 1000 students and staff are self-isolating. In response to the new outbreaks, restrictions have been reintroduced in the Copenhagen area. The private gathering limit has been reduced from 100 to 50 people, and no fans will be allowed at any sporting events. All eateries in Copenhagen must close by midnight, and social activities connected to schools must be cancelled. Public sector employees in the region will return to working from home for at least the next two weeks. The Danish government has advised against travel to France and Croatia as both countries experience a resurgence in new cases. Testing capacity at the Copenhagen Airport will be doubled in the coming days, and new testing centres will be set up throughout the capital region. Despite the concerning rise in cases, a new poll showed that the Danish government has among the highest approval ratings in the world concerning its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A number of measures introduced to contain the spread of the outbreak in Aarhus have been extended until September 4. The measures include a recommendation to work from home, avoid crowded public places, and use distance learning when possible. Although the situation in the city has improved, authorities warned residents of high infection rates. 71 new infections were reported in Denmark on August 21, the country’s lowest daily increase since new outbreaks began at the beginning of August. Public health officials said that while the decline is encouraging, infections have been largely stable for the past two weeks. As demand for testing in Denmark has grown, wait times have been reported to be as much as a few days in some areas. Opposition parties expressed concern to the Minister of Health, who said that the government was working to increase testing capacity as soon as possible.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark will mandate the application of face masks on public transit across the entire country on August 22, due to the recent surge in cases. Mandatory mask policies on public transit had previously been implemented in seven Danish cities in response to the outbreak in Aarhus. Despite the rising infection rate, the government announced that it was moving ahead with Phase 4 of its reopening plan. Under this phase, Denmark plans to abolish the requirement that foreign tourists spending at least six nights in the country.  It will also allow bars and restaurants to remain open until 2 am. However, a planned expansion of the private gathering limit to 200 and plans to reopen nightclubs were both pushed back to the next phase, which is scheduled to begin on October 31. Denmark will perform random antibody testing on tens of thousands of residents in an attempt to monitor the true spread of COVID-19. The second quarter of this year saw Denmark’s GDP experience its largest quarterly drop since the early 1990s, when the country began keeping quarterly records of economic data.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 169 new cases of COVID-19 on August 8, the country’s largest daily increase since April 25. Much of the growth in new cases has been driven by outbreaks at a meat processing plant in Ringsted and in Aarhus, Denmark’s second largest city. In response to the outbreak, face masks are now mandatory on public transit in Aarhus. The government has indicated that it may extend this rule to other cities if outbreaks continue. PM Fredericksen urged Danes to maintain social distancing in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 and said that a planned expansion of the private gathering limit from 100 to 200 people would be postponed. The government plans to meet on August 12 to discuss any further reopening, with delays expected for certain aspects of nightlife. Fredericksen said that the government was willing to implement a mandatory mask policy if the infection rate continues to rise. The Danish Foreign Ministry advised against non-essential travel to Spain and Andorra due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in those countries.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark reported 91 new cases of COVID-19 on July 30 in the country’s largest daily increase since May 18. Officials have stressed that one day of data is not concerning, and stated that Denmark’s case numbers are still stable and hospitalizations are going down. A significant proportion of the new cases are connected to an outbreak at a meat processing plant in Ringsted. The plant has since shut down much of its operations and is operating at half-capacity. The Danish Health Agency has recommended that face masks be used on public transit when social distancing is not possible. Danish officials had previously resisted recommending the use of face masks, but rising infection levels in Denmark led to the change in policy. Denmark lifted all travel restrictions on Sweden on August 1, allowing residents of all regions to travel to Denmark for tourism if they have booked accommodation for at least six nights. The residents of several regions in Sweden were already able to travel to Denmark after reporting an infection rate below 20 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of confirmed cases in Denmark has risen sharply over the past two weeks, with 240 new cases diagnosed in the week of July 13 to July 20. However, the Health Minister said that this rise in infections did not necessarily mean there is a major outbreak, and continued to emphasize hygiene and social distancing regulations. Critics have argued that a mandatory mask policy similar to other EU countries could help prevent further spread, but the government has been hesitant to implement such a policy. Bulgaria was added to the list of countries to which non-essential travel is unauthorized, joining Luxembourg, Portugal, and Sweden. Travel restrictions for five additional regions in Sweden were relaxed.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Danish government eased travel restrictions on three more counties in Sweden (Halland, Kalmar and Värmland), and is allowing travellers from Georgia, Uruguay, and Tunisia to enter the country. Denmark is still recommending against unnecessary travel to Georgia and Uruguay due to their quarantine requirements for arriving Danish citizens. The Ministry of Health is encouraging more Danes to download the country’s contact tracing app after it successfully warned 4 people of their potential exposure to COVID-19. Around 745,000 people have downloaded the app, and the Ministry hopes to reach a million downloads soon. Higher passenger traffic at the Copenhagen Airport has caused its testing centre to expand its operating hours and number of testing stations from two to eight. Testing at the airport is still offered free of charge to arriving passengers.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Danish government raised its private gathering limit to 100 people on July 8, allowing larger meetings, conferences, and parties to take place. Some larger public events, including games in the Danish Superliga, have already been permitted to take place with as many as 10,500 people. The private gathering limit will be raised to 200 people on August 8 if there is no associated surge in cases. The Danish Health Agency dropped its opposition to the use of face masks in certain circumstances, recommending the use if a person has to leave self-isolation, is visiting an elderly relative, or is returning from abroad. Public health officials had previously been concerned that their stockpile of masks would run out if they recommended use by the general public. Residents of four Swedish counties on the Danish border may now enter Denmark for leisure travel after they met the criteria for unrestricted entry. All travellers from Sweden must carry documents that confirm their residency in one of the eligible counties.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After the EU offered a list of 15 countries that the continental bloc considered safe for entry into the Schengen Area, Denmark said that they would allow non-essential entry to only six of them: Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Thailand. While the government said the other countries on the EU’s list were not safe enough for entry into Denmark, the government did not reveal why. Travellers from permitted countries will likely have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival, as Danish travellers are required to do the same in those countries. The Danish government is still strongly recommending against travelling to these countries unless necessary. The final month of the Danish Superliga season will be played in front of up to 10,500 fans, depending on stadium capacity. After three successful test matches with 3,000 fans, the government decided that there is minimal risk of infection and up to 500 fans will be allowed in each section of a team’s stadium--as long as physical distancing is maintained. However, a recent match had to be stopped for nearly 20 minutes after fans of both clubs refused to abide by the physical distancing rules; 50 fans were expelled from the stadium.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 25, Denmark opened its borders to tourists from all but six EU/EEA countries:  the exceptions being UK, Sweden, Portugal, Malta, Romania, and Ireland). While only Sweden and the UK are currently ineligible based on the criteria outlined the previous week, the other countries are barred due to restrictions they have imposed on Danish tourists. University students and staff were allowed to return to campus on June 22 to write their final exams and prepare for the fall semester. International students will be permitted to enter the country for the upcoming semester, as education programs have been deemed essential activities. Professional sports teams are now allowed to have fans in attendance at their games, though with limited capacity and social distancing rules applied. While the normal limit for gatherings in Denmark is 500 people, the games are granted an exemption of up to 3000 people. The government has said it will consider allowing more than 3000 people at the games if the infection rate in the country remains low.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A few days after the initial opening of its border to tourists from Norway, Iceland and Germany, Denmark announced that it will open its border to tourists from most European countries on June 27. Eligibility is granted if a country has fewer than 20 cases per 100,000 people over the preceding week. If a country’s infection rate rises to 30 cases per 100,000 people, then tourists will need to quarantine on arrival. Tourists need to show that they have booked accommodation for at least six nights before entering the country. Nordic countries will be assessed on a regional basis, which means residents of certain Swedish regions will be able to enter Denmark even as the country’s infection rate as a whole remains high. Border restrictions with all other countries are currently set to expire on August 31. A town with a large elderly population reported 34 new cases over last weekend in the country’s first major outbreak since the gradual lifting of restrictions began in May. The outbreak is linked to a single long-term care home, but has since spread to two different schools in the town. The Minister of Health said that the outbreak should be taken as a warning to Danes who feel that Denmark is now insulated from the virus.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Denmark lifted a number of restrictions this week as the country moves towards a full reopening of its economy. The gathering limit increased to 50 people, and fitness centres and swimming pools could reopen on June 8. Some events of up to 500 people may be allowed under an as-of-yet unreleased set of guidelines, including weddings and sports events. While these events may be permitted to occur, they must follow the guidelines set out for nightlife, meaning they must end by midnight and limit alcohol sales. Opposition parties railed against this policy, saying that the government was treating Danish citizens like children. The government later reached an agreement with opposition parties to raise the gathering limit to 100 people on July 8 and 200 people on August 8, however, there is no timeline for the other restrictions still in place. The government is advising that the 15,000 people who took part in an anti-racism protest in Copenhagen this week be tested for COVID-19 due to fears of a mass spread of the virus. PM Frederiksen has conceded that her decision to lockdown Denmark in March was largely political after facing criticism that she ignored the advice of public health officials in the early days of the crisis.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, the Foreign Minister of Denmark announced that Danes who travel to Iceland, Norway or Germany may return without self-isolating as long as they did not visit cities with populations larger than 750,000. Since Iceland and Norway do not have cities of that size, this restriction only applies to arrivals from Germany. Although travel advisories regarding all other countries are a recommendation and are not mandatory, they are expected to remain in place until August 31. Tourists from Iceland, Norway and Germany will be allowed into Denmark if they show proof that they have lodging booked for a minimum six night stay outside of Copenhagen and will be randomly asked to submit to an optional COVID-19 test. New guidelines on gatherings are expected to be released next week and anticipated to permit gatherings with 30-50 people. Opposition parties are pushing for the higher end of the spectrum to allow for more events.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Scandinavian airline SAS, of which the Danish state is a major shareholder, is resuming a number of domestic and international flights this week after laying off nearly half of its workforce in April. Aircrafts will operate at a reduced capacity, though increasing the number of routes has doubled the number of planes needed to service passengers. Denmark and Norway have reached an agreement to open their border to each other’s tourists from June 15th, in a deal that excludes Sweden despite Swedish diplomatic pressure to open all Nordic nations at once. PM Frederiksen has been accused of lying to the Danish people in her initial announcement of lockdown restrictions by saying that the measures taken had been approved by state agencies. Records from the Public Health and Infectious Diseases agencies indicate that they did not recommend the strict restrictions that were implemented, and had even advised against some of them in the weeks prior to the announcement.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Negotiations between the Danish government and opposition parties have been ongoing for the past few weeks as Denmark aims to gradually return to normal lie. As part of its plan, Denmark has announced that all Danish adults will have the opportunity to be tested for coronavirus, including those who have no symptoms. While the program will only be open to 18-to-25 year olds initially, it will gradually be expanded to all age groups in the coming months. A clarification on the age range was issued after tens of thousands of Danes attempted to make an appointment on the government’s online service, only to be told they were ineligible. Denmark’s virus reproduction rate has remained below 1 since its initial stage of reopening, staying between 0.6 and 0.9 even as restrictions have loosened. The government and opposition came to an agreement that moved up some aspects of the reopening plan, allowing cultural institutions to open on May 21st and expanding the list of reasons a foreigner could enter Denmark to allow for visiting relatives and checking on second homes (only available to Nordic residents and Germans). The government has promised to release a plan for the tourism industry by May 29th after business leaders and members of the opposition have criticized the lack of clarity over border controls.</p>
