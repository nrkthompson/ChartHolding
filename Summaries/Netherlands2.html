      Bars and restaurants are scheduled to  reopen within the second stage of the deconfinement strategy, effective June 1st, allowing up to 30 guests inside with unlimited numbers outside, provided a 1.5 metre distance is maintained. Cinemas, theatres, and concert halls are also subject to open to a 30 guest maximum. Face masks are mandatory on public transport for anyone 13 and over, with a fine of 95 euros charged to those in violation. Public transport unions are concerned over the execution of monitoring and penalization of violators on public transport but were assured that effective inspection on trains by chief conductors and local authorities on buses and trams would occur. The Dutch Muslim Association also recommended the application of face masks and gloves during prayers, since groups of up to 30 will be allowed to attend services on June 1st.  As of May 26th, the Netherlands borders are  open for tourists from Schengen countries, which allow free movement without a visa, while U.K. citizens are permitted only upon full declaration of their health.
