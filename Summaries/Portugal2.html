      As part of the phase 3 deconfinement plan set out by the government,  malls and hotels are set to reopen with social distancing and COVID-19 protection measures in place, effective June 1st.  The guests at the hotel will not be able to check in to their rooms until 24 hours after the previous guests have left. Sunbeds will be given exclusively to hotel guests and buffets are unlikely to resume. Beaches will reopen by June 6th, with new rules in place, requiring sunbathers to stay 1.5 metres apart, with their umbrellas at  3 metres apart. The number of people on a beach will be strictly controlled, with a traffic light system in place to show the capacity available. This information will be made available in real time by the Portuguese Environment Agency, through an app. While the dates for reopening of hotels and beaches have already been set, nothing has been announced for the resumption of flights into the country, even though the PM did give a welcome back statement to tourists from May 22nd,  with precautionary measures at airports and no compulsory quarantine in place. Earlier this month, Portugal's flag carrier TAP did resume some of its international operations, with flights to London and Paris, but flights outside the EU are still temporarily suspended.
