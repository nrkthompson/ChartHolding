  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The partners of Norwegian citizens and residents from outside the EU/EEA are permitted to enter the country, effective July 15. Partners must be able to prove that they have been in a relationship for at least nine months, and must have met the Norwegian resident physically at least once to be eligible. The Norwegian resident must fill out a form that confirms these requirements, and must also ensure that the partner quarantines for 10 days upon their arrival. Grandparents and parents of adult children from outside the EU/EEA are still not permitted to enter the country. Some opposition parties have said that the government should allow more exemptions to travel restrictions, but the Minister of Justice said that they will continue to be cautious. More than 100 people in Bergen may need to self-isolate after two infected individuals used public transport, and visited a gym and a restaurant in the city.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway has opened to tourism to and from all EU and Schengen Area countries except for Bulgaria, Croatia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Hungary, and most of Sweden. All self-isolation requirements have been lifted for safe EU and Schengen Area countries, while residents of the exempted seven countries must quarantine themselves for 10 days upon their arrival. Norway’s Data Protection Agency has ordered that public health officials stop all analysis of data collected by the country’s contact tracing app. Use of the app was suspended last month, and public health officials said that they deleted all data they had when the suspension was announced. Data privacy advocates said that the app went above and beyond what was necessary in the fight against COVID-19. Amnesty International said that it was among the most invasive apps in the world. This ruling indicates that the app will not be ready for a re-release before the fall. Public health officials said they will continue testing and tweaking the app to get it ready prior to a second wave.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite the EU’s release of safe third countries, Norway continues to ban travel from non-EU/EEA countries until at least August 20. It is unclear whether the changes announced by the EU will alter Norway’s timeline; the continental bloc left it up to each Schengen Area country to implement the changes they see fit. A German family was deported after they were found entering the country illegally. Norway is currently only open to tourists from Denmark, Iceland and Finland. The country is set to open to some Schengen Area countries on July 15, and will publish the list of safe countries on July 10. Several staff and students at a school outside Oslo have tested positive for COVID-19 in the country’s worst outbreak since lockdown was lifted. All those affected and their contacts are now self-isolating. Norway’s top public health official was reportedly informed of the Minister of Health’s decision to close schools in March only one hour before the announcement. The closures went against the recommendations of her agency. A number of other top officials were also uninformed and were left scrambling to update their policies following the announcement.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 15, Norway will allow unrestricted travel to and from EU/EEA countries that have an infection rate below 20 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks, an average of 0.5 new admissions to the ICU over the same period, and fewer than 5% positive tests. The lifting of restrictions comes after polls indicated that over 5% of respondents explicitly said they would defy the government’s advice and travel to southern Europe over the next few months. While not an outright ban, Norwegians who travel to countries that do not meet the criteria will need to quarantine themselves for at least 10 days upon their return.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government-sponsored contact tracing app will be discontinued in Norway. Data agency officials said that the low infection rate in Norway and the low number of downloads of the app made the invasion of privacy from its operation disproportionate to its benefit for contact tracing. Public health officials said they would respect the ruling but vehemently disagreed with the assessment of the app, saying that the decision will weaken the country’s response to the pandemic. Only 600,000 of the nearly 5.5 million people in the country had downloaded the app. Family members of Norwegians who live outside the EU/EEA will now be permitted to visit, though they will still be subject to a ten day quarantine on arrival. The new guidelines were issued after a loophole in the previous regulations was discovered that allowed the families of EU citizens living in Norway, but not the families of Norwegian citizens, to enter the country.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Health authorities in Norway are concerned that an anti-racism protest in Oslo that drew nearly 15,000 people could lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases. Contrary to a protest the week before in Sweden, where police in Oslo allowed the protest to go ahead despite clear violations of gathering limits and social distancing regulations. The government is encouraging all those who attended the protest to get tested for the virus if they show any symptoms within the next few days. These concerns come as Oslo has seen its number of new COVID-19 cases triple in the last week. Public health officials downplayed the seriousness of the rise in cases as the total infection rate in the country remains very low. The Public Health Agency is recommending that testing guidelines be changed to allow those with extremely mild symptoms to access testing. Additionally, public health officials said that their current testing capacity of 100,000 is nowhere close to being reached, and could even be increased relatively easily if given the resources.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Bars that do not serve food were allowed to reopen this week with some restrictions. Establishments are limited to table service and must close by 11:30pm and gatherings are limited to 20 people with a minimum 1 metre distance between people not from the same household. Several other changes to quarantine rules were also announced. People who come into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 no longer need to isolate themselves, unless they live in the same household or have a close relationship. Business travellers from Nordic countries no longer need to isolate themselves when leaving and entering Norway.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Travel restrictions will remain in place for the next few months, as the government has rejected the request of a Swedish border town for its residents to be exempt from quarantine rules when crossing the border. Norway has advised its citizens to refrain from international travel for the rest of the summer and will not remove any border restrictions until at least June 15. Schools in Norway will largely return to normal next week after the government allowed whole classes to be taught together during normal operating hours. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has issued a report saying that lockdown measures in the country were likely unnecessary by the time they were implemented. The Director of the Institute has said that releasing this report was important to raise questions about the effectiveness of locking down in the event of a second wave later this year. PM Solberg has agreed with the report’s conclusions, though she has said that she believes that the government was right to implement a lockdown at the time.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Norwegian government has said that it is likely to keep travel restrictions in place until at least August 20th, but is willing to consider opening its borders to Nordic countries by June 15th and the rest of Europe by July 20th. Foreign seasonal workers in essential industries have been permitted to enter, but they must submit to a 10-day quarantine upon arrival. Prime Minister Solberg has said that although these restrictions may be lifted, those attempting to enter Norway without a business reason will likely be sent away for the foreseeable future. Despite a low level of infection across the country, the state epidemiologist has said that he does not think that Norway will fall victim to a large second wave of the virus, as the lockdown measures they implemented in March were highly effective. However, the Chief of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has said she believes the virus could have been controlled without the strict lockdown measures that were put in place.</p>
