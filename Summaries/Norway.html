  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in Norway has remained relatively stable over the past week. However, an outbreak of the UK variant in the Oslo area prompted the government to impose further restrictions there on January 24. Non-essential stores have closed, schools have moved to remote learning, all public events have been cancelled, restaurants are takeout only, and residents have been urged to restrict their movements until January 31. Local officials in Oslo had previously extended their social lockdown restrictions until February 4. Nationally, the government lifted its ban on serving alcohol in restaurants and bars on January 22. However, no new guests may be admitted to restaurants and bars after 10 pm. Alcohol must be purchased with food, and selling alcohol is prohibited after midnight. The prime minister said that the government will wait to lift other restrictions.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The epidemiological situation in Norway worsened over the holidays, though it appears to have stabilized somewhat over the past week. As a result, authorities announced that the recommendation against all private indoor gatherings will be lifted on January 20. While not a legal restriction, officials said that private indoor gatherings should now be limited to five people and that private outdoor gatherings can have up to 20 people. Public indoor gatherings with fixed seating can have up to 200 people; the limit is 600 if the event is outdoors. The government extended its recommendation against non-essential travel until March 1. Norway will begin testing all arrivals at the border and will issue fines to those who refuse to comply. The tests are in addition to previous requirements, including a negative test result from no more than three days prior to departure, registration with local authorities, and a week-long quarantine. Due to a rising infection rate, local officials in Bergen may re-introduce strict restrictions that were in place in the city in November.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The infection rate in Norway has remained relatively stable over the past week. All national restrictions will remain in place until at least January 31 and the local restrictions in Oslo are also expected to remain until the same date. Local officials in Trondheim announced that they would introduce a mandatory mask policy in all indoor public spaces until at least January 9. Local officials in Bergen lifted all of their city-wide restrictions on December 18, with the city returning to the national measures on the same date. Norway has banned all passenger flights from the UK for at least 48 hours due to the discovery of a new strain of COVID-19. Authorities said they would test all those who have arrived from the UK in the past two weeks for COVID-19. Norway is expected to begin its vaccination program on December 27 if the EU approves the Pfizer vaccine by December 23, as in other European countries. The first vaccines will be administered in Oslo -- with long-term care home residents and healthcare workers expected to receive it initially.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The infection rate in Norway has remained relatively stable over the past week after three consecutive weeks of declining case numbers. Local officials in Oslo announced that most current restrictions will remain in place until at least January 7. A few will be eased during the holiday season: religious services with fixed seating may have up to 20 people and youth clubs may host up to 20 people. Norway will digitally register everyone who enters the country from January 1, with all travellers required to provide their name, contact information, where they are quarantining, and their Norwegian employer (if applicable). Travellers entering the country will also have the option to avoid staying in a state-run quarantine hotel if they have other suitable accommodation. Travellers must be able to avoid all close contact with others, have their own bathroom, and have private access to food in order to qualify. Public health officials said that Norwegians should limit themselves to hosting or attending two social gatherings during the holidays.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 4, Norway reported a two-week average of 121 new cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people. Infections, hospitalizations, and deaths have been falling for the past three weeks. Public health officials have decreased their risk assessment from ÔhighÕ to ÔmoderateÕ but warned of an increasing infection rate due to the holidays. In spite of this warning, authorities said they may raise gathering limits for a few days during the holidays to allow residents to see up to 10 people at their home. At the same time, the government continues to urge Norwegians to limit their social contacts. The government expects most healthcare workers and members of at-risk groups will be vaccinated by the end of March, with the general public following soon after.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new cases in Norway has remained relatively stable over the past week and appears to be on a downward trend for the first time since September. Local officials in Oslo have extended their Ôsocial lockdownÕ restrictions until at least December 18. All indoor events in the city remain prohibited, all cultural and leisure activities are closed, upper secondary schools are online, and the sale of alcohol at all eateries is banned. All national restrictions were also extended by three weeks, including recommendations to avoid social contact and stay home as much as possible. Guidelines for the upcoming holiday season are forthcoming. The Norwegian government will not make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory but did not rule out restrictions for those who choose not to get it.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 23, the two-week average of new cases in Norway was reported to be 149.8 per 100,000 people. Local officials in Oslo have moved grades 8 to 10 to distance learning and banned all leisure activities and sports for teenagers due to rising cases among that age group. Oslo remains in a Òsocial lockdownÓ, with most public and private gatherings prohibited. Public health officials said that high-risk groups will be prioritized over essential workers when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available in Norway in the spring.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of November 16, Norway has a two-week average of 139.5 new cases per 100,000 people. The government has asked all travellers who have arrived from Denmark in the past two weeks to quarantine for 10 days and get tested for COVID-19 as soon as possible due to concerns over the mink-borne mutation of the virus. Authorities in Oslo are expected to introduce further restrictions on schools in the coming days -- including a reduction in class size for students in lower secondary school, varying attendance times, and moving some classes online. Local officials in Bergen are urging residents to follow the current restrictions as the R0 number in the city has risen to 1.6.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway reported 705 new cases of COVID-19 on November 3 -- the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. As a result, the prime minister announced that social distancing from people in at-risk groups is mandatory and that the gathering limit was lowered to 20 for private events, 50 for indoor non-seated public events, and 200 for indoor seated public events. All travellers from high-risk countries must present a negative test result upon their arrival, and those without an address or employer in Norway must spend their quarantine period at an isolation facility. Local officials in Oslo have banned all indoor events, closed all cultural and leisure activities, and banned the serving of alcohol at all restaurants and bars. The city of Bergen also issued significant local restrictions: working from home is now mandatory, all leisure and cultural facilities must close, restaurants and bars must close at 10 pm, and the gathering limit was lowered to 20 people in all circumstances.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway reported 433 new cases of COVID-19 on October 27 Ñ the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The government announced that the gathering limit would be lowered to 50 people and they are introducing a quarantine requirement for incoming work-related travellers. The government has asked residents to refrain from seeing more than 5 other people each week, though this is not a legal limit. Local officials in Oslo also introduced new restrictions: masks are mandatory at all indoor public places, gatherings are limited to 20 people, and no new guests will be permitted at bars after 10 pm. Local officials in Bergen have implemented tighter restrictions as well: a public gathering limit of 50, a private gathering limit of 10, mandatory masks at all indoor public places and on public transit, customer registration at all restaurants, and a ban on alcohol sales after midnight.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of people with COVID-19 who have been hospitalized in Norway is now at 54, the highest number since late May. Norway has a two-average of 37.7 new cases per 100,000 people as of October 26, the lowest figure in Europe according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Nearly 25 doctors in Troms¿, Trondheim, Narvik, Bergen and Stavanger will go on strike this week for the on-call hours only. The strike will not affect their regular hours, and larger cities were chosen in order to ease the strain of the shortage on smaller municipalities during the pandemic. Negotiations between the union and the state are expected to continue well into next week.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway reported 183 new cases of COVID-19 on October 17. Most cases have been concentrated in the Oslo area. Local officials in the city have extended their restrictions until further notice, including a mandatory mask policy on public transit and a private gathering ban of 10 people. Extended family members from non-EEA countries will be permitted to enter Norway from October 21, but must observe the 10-day quarantine requirement upon their arrival. After negotiators failed to reach an agreement, a doctorÕs strike may begin across the country on October 26. The strike would impact municipal on-call and emergency services, though negotiations are expected to continue in order to avoid a work stoppage.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The infection rate in Norway has remained relatively stable over the past month, though cases in Oslo have risen precipitously in recent days. Due to the situation in Oslo, local officials have extended all COVID-19 restrictions indefinitely, and they appear likely to be in place through the rest of the year. As Norway introduced travel restrictions on Cyprus, Latvia, and Liechtenstein this week, quarantine requirements exist for travellers from all other countries in Europe. The only exceptions are a single region in Sweden and most regions in Finland, although some of the most populated areas (including Helsinki) are restricted. The government announced that a COVID-19 vaccine will be made available to all residents for free whenever it is available.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway will ease some of their remaining national restrictions on October 12. The gathering limit at outdoor events will be expanded to 600 people, although attendees must be divided into groups of 200 and practice social distancing. Recreational sports for adults will be permitted and serving alcohol will be allowed after 12am. Despite the easing of national restrictions, local officials in Oslo have announced harsher measures due to a rising infection rate in the city. Indoor events where attendees are not seated will be limited to 50 people, a mandatory mask policy will be implemented on public transit, and customer registration at restaurants all came into effect on September 29. NorwayÕs health minister advised that municipalities in OsloÕs surrounding area also implement similar restrictions. A number of the municipalities have complied with the advice. Prime Minister Solberg has ruled out an exemption from travel restrictions for Sweden after Swedish officials and residents of border towns had lobbied the government for a change. Regional travel restrictions for Nordic countries are expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Local officials in Oslo banned all private gatherings of more than 10 people effective September 22, and recommended the use of face masks in indoor public spaces where it is difficult to maintain one-metre of distance, as well as on public transit. Working from home is also recommended when possible, and cafes and restaurants must register the contact information of all customers. Authorities are also considering a limit of 50 people at all public events in the city, but this has yet to be implemented. Some public health officials are concerned about the rising infection rate in the country related to public transit, coinciding with the ongoing bus driver strikes across Norway. Officials are worried about overcrowding on alternative forms of public transit and reminded all passengers to wear a mask.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway will impose a quarantine period on all travellers from Denmark; all Danish regions have surpassed the Norwegian infection threshold for restriction-free entry. The Norwegian government also imposed the requirement on one Finnish region, while removing the restriction for Poland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, two Swedish regions, and another Finnish region. PM Solberg has warned Norwegians that additional national restrictions may be put in place due to an increasing infection rate in the country. Special restrictions have already been put in place for the city of Bergen, including a lower gathering limit and mandatory mask policy. Infection rates in Sweden have been lower than those in Norway for the entire month of September, leading to some speculation that the travel restrictions between the two countries will be eased. However, Sweden’s infection rate remains higher than the Norwegian threshold for quarantine-free travel. Norway’s Chief Epidemiologist Frode Forland has also rejected his Swedish counterpart’s theory that Sweden’s high COVID-19 death rate is due to a comparatively mild flu season in recent years. Forland said that the flu seasons in Sweden and Norway have been very similar, and the higher death rate in Sweden is due to a lack of lockdown restrictions early on in the pandemic.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The per-capita rate of new cases is now higher in Norway than it is in Sweden for the first time since the beginning of April. Public health officials said that two localized outbreaks have driven much of the increase in cases and that the rate in most of the country remains low and stable. The high number of new cases in Norway over the past two weeks have pushed the country above its own quarantine criteria for international travel. Authorities said they did not anticipate dividing Norway into ‘green’ and ‘red’ regions as they do internationally, but may implement local restrictions. Norway has since added Hungary, Slovakia, one Danish region, and two Swedish regions to its quarantine list for travellers. The government said that police would issue larger fines for those caught hosting parties that violate the gathering limit. The Justice Minister said police would be given the resources that would allow them to perform these inspections more frequently.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway will reintroduce travel restrictions for the UK, Ireland, Austria, Greece, and the Copenhagen region of Denmark. Travellers from these countries will have to  self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival. All of them surpassed 20 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks. One region in Sweden was moved to Norway’s ‘yellow’ list -- meaning that the government has warned against travel to and from the country, but no restrictions remain in place. The number of new cases fell to 261 last week, but the infection rate is still much higher than it was a month ago. Public health officials said they do not feel the need to reintroduce a lockdown because they have a better understanding of what it takes to contain an outbreak.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway reintroduced travel restrictions on Iceland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Cyprus, and two regions in Denmark due to rising infection rates. All travellers from restricted countries must quarantine for ten days upon their arrival in Norway. The government also announced that it is recommending against all international travel for the time being, even if countries don’t have required quarantine periods for Norwegians. Norway reported 357 new infections last week, significantly more than the week before. The Norwegian Directorate of Health said they are recommending the use of face masks on public transit in Oslo. The measure comes into effect on August 17.  Authorities may recommend masks in all indoor public spaces if infection rates continue to rise. A referral from a doctor is no longer needed to get tested for COVID-19 in Norway.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway reported 196 new cases of COVID-19 during the week of July 27 to August 2, after reporting 94 cases the week before. In response to the rising infection rate, the government postponed some planned reopening measures and instead implemented new restrictions. A national ban has been implemented on serving alcohol after midnight. Working from home is recommended as much as possible. The gathering limit is expected to remain at 200 people. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health is expected to recommend wearing masks on public transit in the coming days. Arrivals from Switzerland and France will need to quarantine for 10 days due to rising infection rates. The Norwegian school year begins this week, with students and staff in all schools expected to follow social distancing regulations and enhanced cleaning measures.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A local COVID-19 outbreak has been found in the town of Moss, around 60 kilometres south of Oslo. 24 people in the town have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past two weeks, with most infections traced to a single private event. However, the origin of some of the cases is still unknown. Neighbouring municipalities have been consulted about the outbreak in Moss; some of their residents were present at the event in question. Due to another outbreak on a Norwegian cruise ship, the government announced that it will restrict the ability of cruise passengers and crew to go ashore. No cruise ships will dock at a Norwegian port for at least the next two weeks. Norway will likely recommend that all those who can work from home continue to do so for the rest of 2020. On August 1, the Norwegian government reintroduced travel restrictions for Belgium, forcing all travellers from that country to self-isolate for 10 days upon their arrival in Norway. Travel restrictions on Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic are also likely to be reintroduced this week after those three countries reported increasing caseloads.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway re-introduced travel restrictions for Spain and Andorra on July 24 after the countries experienced a number of new COVID-19 outbreaks. The Norwegian government also lifted restrictions against the residents of several Swedish regions and Hungary after their infection rates fell in the past two weeks. Despite the EU’s recommendation that face masks be worn on all public transit, Norway has no plans to introduce a mandatory mask policy at this time. The Institute of Public Health (IPH) said that wearing a face mask gave Norwegians a false sense of security and encouraged them to disregard hygiene and social distancing measures. Officials from the IPH said they would consider instituting a mask policy if the infection rate in Norway rose again.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The partners of Norwegian citizens and residents from outside the EU/EEA are permitted to enter the country, effective July 15. Partners must be able to prove that they have been in a relationship for at least nine months, and must have met the Norwegian resident physically at least once to be eligible. The Norwegian resident must fill out a form that confirms these requirements, and must also ensure that the partner quarantines for 10 days upon their arrival. Grandparents and parents of adult children from outside the EU/EEA are still not permitted to enter the country. Some opposition parties have said that the government should allow more exemptions to travel restrictions, but the Minister of Justice said that they will continue to be cautious. More than 100 people in Bergen may need to self-isolate after two infected individuals used public transport, and visited a gym and a restaurant in the city.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Norway has opened to tourism to and from all EU and Schengen Area countries except for Bulgaria, Croatia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Hungary, and most of Sweden. All self-isolation requirements have been lifted for safe EU and Schengen Area countries, while residents of the exempted seven countries must quarantine themselves for 10 days upon their arrival. Norway’s Data Protection Agency has ordered that public health officials stop all analysis of data collected by the country’s contact tracing app. Use of the app was suspended last month, and public health officials said that they deleted all data they had when the suspension was announced. Data privacy advocates said that the app went above and beyond what was necessary in the fight against COVID-19. Amnesty International said that it was among the most invasive apps in the world. This ruling indicates that the app will not be ready for a re-release before the fall. Public health officials said they will continue testing and tweaking the app to get it ready prior to a second wave.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite the EU’s release of safe third countries, Norway continues to ban travel from non-EU/EEA countries until at least August 20. It is unclear whether the changes announced by the EU will alter Norway’s timeline; the continental bloc left it up to each Schengen Area country to implement the changes they see fit. A German family was deported after they were found entering the country illegally. Norway is currently only open to tourists from Denmark, Iceland and Finland. The country is set to open to some Schengen Area countries on July 15, and will publish the list of safe countries on July 10. Several staff and students at a school outside Oslo have tested positive for COVID-19 in the country’s worst outbreak since lockdown was lifted. All those affected and their contacts are now self-isolating. Norway’s top public health official was reportedly informed of the Minister of Health’s decision to close schools in March only one hour before the announcement. The closures went against the recommendations of her agency. A number of other top officials were also uninformed and were left scrambling to update their policies following the announcement.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 15, Norway will allow unrestricted travel to and from EU/EEA countries that have an infection rate below 20 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks, an average of 0.5 new admissions to the ICU over the same period, and fewer than 5% positive tests. The lifting of restrictions comes after polls indicated that over 5% of respondents explicitly said they would defy the government’s advice and travel to southern Europe over the next few months. While not an outright ban, Norwegians who travel to countries that do not meet the criteria will need to quarantine themselves for at least 10 days upon their return.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government-sponsored contact tracing app will be discontinued in Norway. Data agency officials said that the low infection rate in Norway and the low number of downloads of the app made the invasion of privacy from its operation disproportionate to its benefit for contact tracing. Public health officials said they would respect the ruling but vehemently disagreed with the assessment of the app, saying that the decision will weaken the country’s response to the pandemic. Only 600,000 of the nearly 5.5 million people in the country had downloaded the app. Family members of Norwegians who live outside the EU/EEA will now be permitted to visit, though they will still be subject to a ten day quarantine on arrival. The new guidelines were issued after a loophole in the previous regulations was discovered that allowed the families of EU citizens living in Norway, but not the families of Norwegian citizens, to enter the country.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Health authorities in Norway are concerned that an anti-racism protest in Oslo that drew nearly 15,000 people could lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases. Contrary to a protest the week before in Sweden, where police in Oslo allowed the protest to go ahead despite clear violations of gathering limits and social distancing regulations. The government is encouraging all those who attended the protest to get tested for the virus if they show any symptoms within the next few days. These concerns come as Oslo has seen its number of new COVID-19 cases triple in the last week. Public health officials downplayed the seriousness of the rise in cases as the total infection rate in the country remains very low. The Public Health Agency is recommending that testing guidelines be changed to allow those with extremely mild symptoms to access testing. Additionally, public health officials said that their current testing capacity of 100,000 is nowhere close to being reached, and could even be increased relatively easily if given the resources.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Bars that do not serve food were allowed to reopen this week with some restrictions. Establishments are limited to table service and must close by 11:30pm and gatherings are limited to 20 people with a minimum 1 metre distance between people not from the same household. Several other changes to quarantine rules were also announced. People who come into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 no longer need to isolate themselves, unless they live in the same household or have a close relationship. Business travellers from Nordic countries no longer need to isolate themselves when leaving and entering Norway.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Travel restrictions will remain in place for the next few months, as the government has rejected the request of a Swedish border town for its residents to be exempt from quarantine rules when crossing the border. Norway has advised its citizens to refrain from international travel for the rest of the summer and will not remove any border restrictions until at least June 15. Schools in Norway will largely return to normal next week after the government allowed whole classes to be taught together during normal operating hours. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has issued a report saying that lockdown measures in the country were likely unnecessary by the time they were implemented. The Director of the Institute has said that releasing this report was important to raise questions about the effectiveness of locking down in the event of a second wave later this year. PM Solberg has agreed with the report’s conclusions, though she has said that she believes that the government was right to implement a lockdown at the time.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Norwegian government has said that it is likely to keep travel restrictions in place until at least August 20th, but is willing to consider opening its borders to Nordic countries by June 15th and the rest of Europe by July 20th. Foreign seasonal workers in essential industries have been permitted to enter, but they must submit to a 10-day quarantine upon arrival. Prime Minister Solberg has said that although these restrictions may be lifted, those attempting to enter Norway without a business reason will likely be sent away for the foreseeable future. Despite a low level of infection across the country, the state epidemiologist has said that he does not think that Norway will fall victim to a large second wave of the virus, as the lockdown measures they implemented in March were highly effective. However, the Chief of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has said she believes the virus could have been controlled without the strict lockdown measures that were put in place.</p>
