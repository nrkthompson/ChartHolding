      After weeks of lobbying, on June 15 personal-care businesses, such as hair and nail salons, were allowed to reopen in Michigan, the last state that kept those businesses closed. Governor Gretchen Whitmer has extended the state of emergency as Michigan is on track to contain COVID-19, but not out of the woods yet. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker announced on June 17 a $900 million financial relief package across ten programs, including rental assistance and an evictions ban through the summer. On June 18, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York City is on track to enter phase 2 of reopening on June 22, as the number of confirmed cases continue to decrease (even though the number of active cases continues to gradually increase). This will allow restaurants and bars to open for outdoor service, along with offices, indoor retail, hair salons and barbershops, with hygienic conditions. On June 17, Maine Governor Janet Mills announced that the three remaining counties were allowed to reopen bars or restaurants for outdoor service, as well as gyms, with face coverings encouraged, but not yet mandatory.

      Restaurants and bars in Michigan started serving customers on-site, with capacity limits, on June 8. Public swimming pools and day camps were also allowed to reopen on June 8, with up to 50% capacity. On June 10, northern Michigan (including counties that border Canada) entered phase 5 of reopening, allowing salons, movie theaters and gyms to reopen with reduced capacity. Exactly 100 days after the first case was confirmed in New York, the City entered phase 1 of its reopening plan on June 8, allowing nonessential businesses, manufacturing, construction and select other industries to continue their work, with a limited capacity of 50%. Stores allowed customers to pick up goods either curbside or with in-person appointments. If the number of hospitalizations continues its downward trend, the City will follow the rest of the state and move on to the next phase by the end of the month. In Maine, 13 of the state’s 16 counties (all border counties with Canada) reopened gyms, bars and tasting rooms for outdoor service as part of the state’s rural reopening plan.

      Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer lifted the stay-at-home order on June 1, allowing workplaces, retailers and restaurants to reopen with hygiene restrictions. Fitness centres, recreation businesses and personal care services remain closed. Michigan is the only state with hair salons completely closed, yet outdoor graduation parties with up to 100 people can take place. Mayor Lightfoot of Chicago announced that the city entered Phase 3 of Illinois' reopening plan, allowing non-essential businesses, including offices, retail, restaurants (outdoor) and gyms (outdoor) to reopen. North Dakota’s Governor Doug Burgum expressed concerns regarding the protests, saying that  singing and shouting releases respiratory droplets that could cause COVID-19 to spread. In an attempt to boost tourism, the Governor of Maine announced that the mandatory 14-day quarantine would be lifted if a traveler produces a negative COVID-19 test prior to arrival. Governor Cuomo of New York announced that restaurants counties in Phase II will be allowed to reopen for outdoor dining. New York City is expected to finally enter Phase I on June 8, but with the current political climate, this might be pushed back. Currently, there is a curfew instated till June 7 in New York City due to the ongoing protests.

      Michigan Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, extended a stay-home order through to  June 12th. A coalition of barber shops, salons, and spas came together and presented an eight-step reopening plan to the Governor, asking her to lift the ban on their businesses. A few malls in Metro Detroit reopened on May 28th, following the Governor's executive order allowing retail stores to reopen, providing they only let only 10 customers in at a time. Illinois will enter Phase 3 of its reopening plan on May 29th, allowing  manufacturing, offices, retail, barbershops, and salons to reopen with capacity and safety precautions. Gatherings are limited to 10 people or fewer. Face coverings in public are required, and bars and restaurants are only open for pickup and delivery. Maine is experiencing an increase in hospitalizations in certain counties, prompting Governor Janet Mills to postpone Phase 2 of the state's reopening plan. Other counties will continue reopening on June 2, with restaurants offering dine-in services, and fitness centers and nail salons opening. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order that will allow private businesses to deny entry to customers who are not wearing a mask or face covering. The vast majority of regions in the state have made it to phase one of reopening; the only region outstanding at this point is New York City, the hardest-hit region in the state and country. Some parks in NYC have drawn circles to allow people to maintain social distance, a strategy which the City of Toronto has adopted.

      Michigan Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, issued an executive order on May 18th that allowed businesses and restaurants in northern Michigan (border counties with Lake Superior and Sault Ste. Marie) to reopen at reduced capacity (50%) and increased health guidelines on May 22nd. The existing stay-at-home order affecting the rest of the state will remain in effect until May 28th. Illinois remains in Phase 2 of its reopening plan, focusing on flattening the curve by closing non-essential services. Pennsylvania is using a color-coded (red, yellow, green) approach to reopen certain counties. Philadelphia remains "red," meaning stay-at-home orders are enforced; Pittsburgh has moved to yellow, meaning retail stores can reopen, but schools remain closed. New York remains the state with the most daily cases. However, the amount has been consistently decreasing, prompting Governor Cuomo to reopen state beaches ahead of Memorial Day weekend. The governor is also in discussion with major sports teams regarding the resumption of games without spectators. In Maine, bars, nightclubs, and movie theaters remain closed, but restaurants, fitness centers, personal care businesses, and retail stores are open in most counties.
