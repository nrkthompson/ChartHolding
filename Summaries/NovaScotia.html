  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 17, Nova Scotia has four active cases of COVID-19, one of which was identified on August 16.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nova Scotia’s emergency order, which was set to expire on August 10, has been extended until at least August 23.  This is despite there being only 2 active cases in the province and no new cases since August 3.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Nova Scotia Health has released an advisory of a potential exposure to COVID-19 on July 31 at Chebucto Road HRM Park, which had previously been mistakenly reported to have occurred at the Maritime Muslim Academy playground in Halifax. The advisory is related to an individual(s) who may have been asymptomatic before visiting the playground or experiencing mild symptoms that had previously gone unnoticed. The advisory is being issued out of an abundance of caution. In addition, Nova Scotia Health is directly contacting anyone else known to be a close contact of the person(s) confirmed to have COVID-19.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">From July 24, all passengers and drivers of public transport in Nova Scotia are required to wear masks and/or personal protective equipment. As of July 27, the province has reported 12 consecutive days without any new cases of COVID-19, with no active cases remaining in the province.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 22, residents at long-term care facilities may have up to 1 visitor per resident for indoor visits, and up to 5 visitors per resident for outdoor visits. During visits, both residents and visitors are required to wear masks and maintain physical distance from one another. Residents and staff at long-term care facilities can gather in groups of up to 10 without physical distancing. Licensed hair salons in long-term care facilities can now reopen to serve residents. All passengers and drivers on public transportation will be required to wear masks as of July 24.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 10, the government of Nova Scotia decided to extend its state of emergency until at least July 26. As of July 13, the province has gone 4 consecutive days without reporting any new cases of COVID-19, leaving only 3 active cases in the province.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting July 3, travel within the Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador) will be permitted without the requirement to self-isolate for Atlantic Canada residents. Canadians residing outside of Atlantic Canada must self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving in Nova Scotia, unless they have already self-isolated in another Atlantic province--in which case they may enter Nova Scotia without self-isolating again. Also on July 3, social events, religious gatherings, weddings, funerals, cultural events, and other mass gatherings will be allowed to take place with up to 250 people outdoors, and up to 50% capacity--or 200 people--for indoor venues.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government of Nova Scotia is limiting mass gatherings to a maximum of 50 people for both indoor and outdoor gatherings. Public schools and pre-primary education will remain closed for the remainder of the 2019/20 school year, while daycare services and unlicensed childcare providers have been allowed to resume activities in accordance with the province’s ministry of health. Personal services – such as barbers, spas, salons, and body art establishments have been allowed to resume business, along with fitness establishments – such as gyms, yoga studios, and climbing facilities – have been allowed to reopen if they are able to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres between patrons, or a limit of ten patrons at any given time if the appropriate distance cannot be maintained. Restaurants are being allowed to operate at 50% capacity while maintaining a minimum physical distance of 2 metres between tables, or providing customers with a physical barrier between tables if this distance cannot be maintained.</p>
