      With hospitalizations and ICU occupancy decreasing steadily, France entered phase 2 of reopening on June 2. The Paris region remains the only one designated "orange," while the rest of the country is in the green zone, meaning that the rate of infection is low with minimal active circulation. As of June 2, bars, restaurants and cafes opened across the country with 1 meter distance between tables, however, in Paris only terraces remain open. Middle and high schools, along with parks and gardens, have also been permitted to reopen this week. As of Tuesday June 9 in green zones and on June 22 in Paris, swimming pools, gyms, amusement parks, theatres and concert halls will reopen. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain off-limits, and the government's StopCovid tracing app is functioning to tell users when they have been in close contact with a COVID+ patient. The next significant day for reopening in France is June 15, when the country will reopen its borders to tourists within the European Union without a quarantine. While non-EU travelers are not permitted to enter the country at all, travelers from the UK can enter, but will still be subject to a 14-day quarantine. 20,000 people attended a protest in Paris on June 2 in response to the 2016 death of 24-year-old Adama Traor√© in police custody, and increased tensions between visible minorities and police during lockdown.
