      In efforts to improve domestic tourism, the government will be providing vouchers to all permanent residents of Slovenia as a part of a stimulus package.87 As of June 8, citizens from 17 EU and non-EU countries are permitted to enter Slovenia without restrictions under new border crossing rules, including Greece, Switzerland, and Norway. Citizens from Austria, Croatia, and Hungary have already been allowed to cross without health restrictions under bilateral agreements. Nationals from other EU and Schengen zone countries are still subject to a 14 day quarantine on arrival, unless they fall under one of the now 16 exemptions. Confirmation of tourist bookings is no longer considered an exemption.88 Continuous external pressure is adding to political instability and reducing citizens' trust in government amongst media reports that the primary reason for the announcement of the epidemic’s end in mid-May was because of public finances rather than public health.89
