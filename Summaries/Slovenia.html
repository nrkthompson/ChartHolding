  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On January 15, 1,793 daily new cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in Slovenia. The current measures in place have been extended until January 22. The temporary ban on gatherings remains in effect and students will continue to learn remotely. Movement between regions is prohibited between 10 pm and 6 am with some exceptions for essential purposes. On January 14, anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers gathered to protest the current COVID-19 restrictions related to mask-wearing and vaccine recommendations.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 16, Slovenia recorded 1,642 new daily infections and 1,229 hospitalizations. The “state of coronavirus epidemic” was extended by 30 days on December 18. Between December 19 and 23, some specialty shops will be permitted to reopen. In four regions with improving epidemiological situations, more shops, museums, galleries, and libraries will be permitted to reopen. Religious ceremonies will also be permitted effective December 19.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 10, Slovenia reported 1,813 new daily cases of infection and 1,268 new hospitalizations. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in the country is 1,526. Some restrictions in Slovenia will be temporarily eased from December 15 to December 23. Public transportation will resume at 50% capacity, while hair salons, flower shops, and dryer cleaners can reopen. In four regions where the COVID-19 situation is less severe, retail shops and car dealerships may reopen. Despite the inter-municipal ban on movement, people living in these four regions may move between municipalities using the national exposure notification app, OstaniZdrav.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 4, Slovenia reported a 7-day rolling average of 1,461 daily infections and 1,289 people in hospital. The government has adopted a five-tiered strategy for easing restrictions, which includes black, red, orange, yellow, and green tiers. The strategy is based on a 7-day rolling average of daily infections and the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Currently, the country is in the black tier and all existing restrictions have been extended. As the number of daily infections and hospitalizations decline, the country will begin moving toward the green tier, in which all restrictions are lifted but with precautions in place. The government has cut funding for the Slovenia Press Agency. In the past, the prime minister has expressed dissatisfaction with the work of the agency. The opposition is calling on the government to withdraw its decision.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Slovenia, COVID-19 hospitalization, infection, and death rates continue to rise. The government has extended all main lockdown measures for an additional week. As a result, there is a continued ban on gatherings, movement between municipalities, and in-class schooling. Non-essential shops, cultural institutions, and eateries remain closed. The curfew will remain in place and public transport will remain suspended. The Slovenian Business Club is calling for widespread testing and preparation of testing protocols to contain the spread and allow for the economy to reopen.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 20, Slovenia reported 1,552 new cases of COVID-19. Hospitals remain at capacity and nursing homes are becoming a major hotspot. The prime minister said some of the current restrictions could remain in place until Christmas. The chief epidemiologist expressed mixed feelings about the current measures, including the mandatory use of masks outdoors and bans on movement between municipalities.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Due to rising COVID-19 cases, the government has decided to tighten its lockdown restrictions for an additional two weeks. All non-essential stores, public transport, schools, and kindergartens will be closed. All gatherings, with exceptions for people within the same household, will be banned. The government has implemented a legislative package to help alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on business and residents.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Slovenia, the number of daily new infections is decreasing but fatalities and hospitalizations continue to rise. Distance learning will begin for both primary and secondary school students. While kindergartens remain closed, childcare remains available for parents working in essential services. The government extended restrictions on gatherings and on movement between municipalities. Shops and contact services may remain open but there is a one customer per 30 square metres limit in stores. In Slovenia’s capital, Ljubljana, hundreds of anti-restriction demonstrators gathered inciting violence between people and police.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 28, Slovenia reported an average daily case number of 2,488. To combat COVID-19 infections, autumn holidays have been extended an additional week for primary schools and remote learning to resume for secondary schools. COVID-19 measures do not apply to construction, maintenance, and installation work involving minimal customer contact.Contact tracing efforts are no longer possible due to the increase in COVID-19 cases, prompting the launch of a web portal. The portal will enable confirmed patients to receive a code that will activate the exposure notification app.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Currently, there are 1, 961 new daily cases in Slovenia. At this rate, experts warn that hospitals could run out of beds. The government has closed non-essential shops, hotels, kindergartens, and student dorms with plans to re-evaluate the measures next week. The Opposition is blaming the government for badly communicating measures, arguing it has led to low public trust and compliance.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Slovenia, the number of new cases is rising; most new cases are occurring at care homes and in healthcare institutions. The government has formally declared an epidemic, with 9 of Slovenia’s 12 regions having exceeded the government’s threshold of 140 cases per 100,000 residents in a two-week period. On October 14, the government imposed several new restrictions. Beginning in 5th grade, students will begin learning remotely. This rule will also apply to post-secondary institutions. Also, no gatherings of more than 6 people are permitted. Within 9 regions, inter-regional movement has been banned, gatherings are limited to 10 people, masks are mandatory outdoors, and contact services and sporting activities have been cancelled. Effective October 20, a curfew has been set to restrict the movement of citizens between 9:00 pm and 6:00 am.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Slovenia, the number of new daily cases is approximately 300 and the number of school aged children testing positive for COVID-19 has doubled over the past week. Rising cases among young people is likely related to face masks no longer being required for students in their classes and for primary school teachers.As of October 9, there is a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people with exceptions for religious ceremonies and supervised sporting events. At restaurants and bars, capacity has been reduced, and guests can only be served when seated at tables. The government announced that hand sanitizer must be installed in all shared areas of multi-apartment buildings.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new cases per day is rising. The interior minister announced that the government is deciding whether or not to formally declare an epidemic again in Slovenia: “In the coming weeks, the decision will be made based on the epidemiological situation and the health care system’s capacity.” If an epidemic is formally declared, formal legal measures would permit the government to better allocate resources. Effective September 30, passengers arriving to Slovenia from red or orange listed countries will not be required to quarantine if travelers can provide a negative test result that is less than 48 hours old.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of cases are rising in Slovenia as the country records its highest daily numbers since the beginning of the pandemic in March. In bars and restaurants, a curfew of 10:30 pm has been imposed, but guests will have up to an hour to leave the establishment after this time. Discos and night-clubs remain closed. A report by Greenpeace and the Civil Liberties Union for Europe found the government as among the worst offenders to have used COVID-19 as an excuse to restrict freedoms.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Slovenian government has shortened the mandatory quarantine requirement from 14 to 10 days, following recommendations from the medical task force for COVID-19. The task force acknowledges that this may increase the risk of infection but the change will significantly reduce economic burdens. Pivka, a municipality in south-western Slovenia, is the first to impose local restrictions after a rise in infections. The local government has placed a 10-day ban on the use of indoor sporting facilities, as well as all cultural and sporting events held indoors.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 1, primary and secondary students returned to school for in-class instruction. Now in the second week, a number of children are in quarantine due to cases among their classmates. In response, the Education Ministry is developing an app and plans to begin publishing relevant information on a weekly basis. Precarious work in Slovenia has increased due to COVID-19 and the Labour Ministry plans to decide on potential measures following a comprehensive analysis.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective August 21, Croatia is on Sloveniaís red list of countries from which travellers must quarantine for 14 days. More than 140,000 Slovenian citizens visited Croatia this month, prompting the government to ask its citizens to return home. Almost half of Sloveniaís new cases were imported from Croatia, with the most infected people under 35 years of age. The increase in infections was attributed to visits to mass entertainment venues, such as beach parties and nightclubs, where social distancing measures are not being respected. Slovenian health authorities expect infections to rise in the coming weeks as holidaymakers return from Croatia. All primary and secondary school children will return to school on September 1. Social distancing and hygiene measures will be in place. Face  masks are not mandatory for students in classrooms. Sloveniaís contact tracing app, StayWell, has been approved by authorities and is now available for installation on Google Play.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Slovenia, the majority of new cases are in people aged 15-34.A government speaker blamed young people for the continuous spread of COVID-19 due to their disregard for social distancing when attending parties. The government plans to resume school as normal but is preparing for the option of remote learning. The Slovenian Football Association has postponed the start of the new premier league season as players test positive for COVID-19.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of active cases in Slovenia is approximately 167. Slovenia has added Bulgaria, Romania, the Bahamas, and India to its red list of countries that require 14-day quarantine at arrival. Spain, Belgium, Australia, and Canada have been moved from Sloveniaís travel green list and to its yellow list.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sloveniaís contact tracing app is currently operational and being tested by the National Institute of Public Health. The app is expected to become available for download in mid-August. The Association of Social Institutions has left the governmentís COVID-19 task force due to criticism about its lack of  strategy for long-term care homes. A majority of cases have been in long-term care homes, schools, and shops, leading a government spokesperson to urge extra caution in workplaces.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of new infections in Slovenia were transmitted locally, with multiple clusters across the country. A long-term care home in eastern Slovenia is a large hotspot with several residents and employees testing positive for COVID-19. Due to the increased number of infections in the country, Slovenia has been put on a list of countries for which restrictions apply upon entering Finland.  The Slovenian government has changed its criteria for categorizing countries according to its traffic light system (green, yellow, and red) for travel restrictions. The government will no longer only consider the number of infections per 100,000 people over a 14-day period, but will now also assess the possibility of infections spreading or being transmitted to other countries.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 20, Slovenia will issue quarantine orders to all Slovenian citizens and residents returning from countries with high infection rates via border crossings with Croatia. Montenegro and Luxembourg were placed on Sloveniaís quarantine list on July 17. Poland and the UK have been moved to the safe-country list alongside Austria, Belgium, Canada, and Spain. Some countries have gained or retained their epidemiologically-safe status despite a recent rise in cases due to reliable data and only a slight upward trend. On July 15, journalists and media workers gathered to protest against media reforms planned by the Slovenian government. The workers believe the proposed changes would undermine the public mediaís independence and are critical of the governmentís attempt to interfere with the mediaís democratic role.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Slovenia, the government has re-introduced restrictions on public gatherings, with only 10 people now permitted. Official events of up to 50 people are still permitted but only if the organizer keeps a record of all the participants. Slovenia moved France and the Czech Republic back to their list of safe countries just two days after putting them on a list of countries whose citizens must quarantine on arrival. Residents of an eastern region of the Czech Republic remain on the quarantine list. Slovenian citizens and people with residence in Slovenia arriving from a quarantine-listed country do not need to be quarantined if they can prove property ownership or provide a bill for accommodation. The government had intended to implement a compulsory contact tracing app for those who have tested positive or those in quarantine. Failure to use the app would have resulted in a fine of 600 euros. Sloveniaís privacy watchdog, representatives from the Ministries of Health and Public Administration, and opposition parties all expressed their reservations about making the app mandatory. The opposition parties said the government should not use COVID-19 as a reason for excessive encroachment on human rights and civil liberties. On July 13, the Public Administration Minister addressed these concerns and announced that the app will be voluntary.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Croatia, France, and Czechia are no longer listed as COVID-19 safe countries based on new assessments by the Slovenian government. Citizens from these countries arriving in Slovenia must go into quarantine for 14 days but Slovenians returning from these countries are not required to. The municipality of Morav?e, north-east of Sloveniaís capital, has been in lockdown since July 2 after three cases were confirmed. The mayor has banned all public gatherings, made face masks mandatory, and placed strict measures on eateries in order to stop the spread. Despite an investigation into alleged wrongdoing in the procurement of medical supplies and PPE, the economy minister does not intend to resign. The prime minister sent a letter to the state prosecutor saying it is neglecting its legal role with respect to anti-government protests. The letter has been met with strong criticism, especially from the opposition, who cite it as another attack on independent institutions and an encroachment on the legislative branch of power. As a result, the opposition plans to initiate an impeachment motion against the prime minister.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 21, Slovenia had the highest number of daily infections since April 24--prompting several new government measures. In response, the government has made face masks mandatory in indoor public places and on public transportation. With most cases originating from abroad, the government has made adjustments to its list of COVID-19 safe countries from which arrivals face no restrictions. The government has placed Montenegro, Luxembourg, Albania and Portugal on the list of red countries from where entry to Slovenia involves a two week quarantine. The opposition is highly critical of the governmentís crisis measures and the prime ministerís inappropriate and divisive rhetoric on social media towards the opposition and journalists.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective June 15, public gatherings up to 500 people were permitted in Slovenia and spectators could also attend sporting events again. The 500 person capacity limit at sporting events will include athletes, media, security and support staff. All safety recommendations issued by the National Institute of Public Health continue to apply. Slovenia began easing border and travel restrictions on May 15, but after a month the border fence between Italy and Slovenia was taken down because of significant disruptions for town residents. Restriction-free travel to European countries is permitted with controls in place for those arriving from countries deemed high risk, such as the UK and Sweden. Travellers coming from outside of Europe must quarantine for 14 days, including residents who have been outside of the EU for a two week period.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In efforts to improve domestic tourism, the government will be providing vouchers to all permanent residents of Slovenia as a part of a stimulus package. As of June 8, citizens from 17 EU and non-EU countries are permitted to enter Slovenia without restrictions under new border crossing rules, including Greece, Switzerland, and Norway. Citizens from Austria, Croatia, and Hungary have already been allowed to cross without health restrictions under bilateral agreements. Nationals from other EU and Schengen zone countries are still subject to a 14 day quarantine on arrival, unless they fall under one of the now 16 exemptions. Confirmation of tourist bookings is no longer considered an exemption. Continuous external pressure is adding to political instability and reducing citizens' trust in government amongst media reports that the primary reason for the announcement of the epidemicís end in mid-May was because of public finances rather than public health.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Across Slovenia, most lockdown measures have been relaxed. Effective June 1, all hotels, fitness clubs and swimming pools reopened. Public gatherings of up to 200 people will also be permitted. The government ended the mandatory use of face coverings in public, but recommends their use in spaces where social distancing is not possible. On June 3, all primary school students will return to classes under strict hygiene guidelines and social distancing measures. A student tested positive, marking the first case among children after returning to school on May 18. The studentís classmates and teachers are in a two-week quarantine, but the remaining students at the school will continue attending classes. 1,000 police officers have been dispatched to Sloveniaís border with Croatia in efforts to tighten border controls and deter migrants and smugglers. The Health Minister told reporters that conditions at care homes need to be improved and additional health facilities need to be set up to properly provide for patients in the event of a second wave.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Kindergartens, primary schools for grades 1-3, and secondary schools for final year students have resumed, with the majority of eligible students being reported as having returned to school. All restaurants and stores are open but theatres across Slovenia remain closed. It is expected that theatres will be preparing to reopen with rehearsals in the coming weeks but are calling on the government to provide safety guidelines and an official timeline. With a phase reopening to neighbouring countries likely in the coming weeks, 17 news exemptions to the 14 day quarantine requirement for EU and Schengen zone nationals came into effect on May 26. Now, EU citizens can enter as tourists as long as they meet one of the exemptions. Exemptions include confirmation of booking, owning property, and commuting to work. In efforts to prevent another lockdown in the Fall, the Head of the Health Ministry Advisory Task Force, Bojana Beovic, said government efforts should be directed at testing and contact tracing to try to prepare for and delay a second wave. Efforts will also focus on mitigating staffing shortages by training additional essential personnel.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 15, the Slovenian government declared itself the first European country to have put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic within its borders. The Slovenian government will regularly publish a list of countries whose citizens can enter without restrictions based on the COVID-19 situation in surrounding countries. As of now, citizens of Croatia can freely enter without restrictions, and talks with other countries are underway.  The first passenger flights to and from Slovenia are expected to resume on May 26th. In an effort to boost the tourism sector, Slovenia will be giving each citizen a voucher of up to 200 EUR, small hotels with less than 30 rooms will be allowed to reopen, while larger hotels are expected to reopen within the next month. Public gatherings of more than 50 people remain banned, and citizens are obliged to follow social distancing measures and wear face masks in public spaces. On May 18, all shops, bars and restaurants were allowed to reopen. Students in their first three years of primary schools, and pupils in their final years of highschool will return to school - but most will continue online lessons for the rest of the year.</p>
