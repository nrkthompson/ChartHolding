  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective August 21, Croatia is on Slovenia’s red list of countries from which travellers must quarantine for 14 days. More than 140,000 Slovenian citizens visited Croatia this month, prompting the government to ask its citizens to return home. Almost half of Slovenia’s new cases were imported from Croatia, with the most infected people under 35 years of age. The increase in infections was attributed to visits to mass entertainment venues, such as beach parties and nightclubs, where social distancing measures are not being respected. Slovenian health authorities expect infections to rise in the coming weeks as holidaymakers return from Croatia. All primary and secondary school children will return to school on September 1. Social distancing and hygiene measures will be in place. Face  masks are not mandatory for students in classrooms. Slovenia’s contact tracing app, StayWell, has been approved by authorities and is now available for installation on Google Play.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Slovenia, the majority of new cases are in people aged 15-34.A government speaker blamed young people for the continuous spread of COVID-19 due to their disregard for social distancing when attending parties. The government plans to resume school as normal but is preparing for the option of remote learning. The Slovenian Football Association has postponed the start of the new premier league season as players test positive for COVID-19.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of active cases in Slovenia is approximately 167. Slovenia has added Bulgaria, Romania, the Bahamas, and India to its red list of countries that require 14-day quarantine at arrival. Spain, Belgium, Australia, and Canada have been moved from Slovenia’s travel green list and to its yellow list.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Slovenia’s contact tracing app is currently operational and being tested by the National Institute of Public Health. The app is expected to become available for download in mid-August. The Association of Social Institutions has left the government’s COVID-19 task force due to criticism about its lack of  strategy for long-term care homes. A majority of cases have been in long-term care homes, schools, and shops, leading a government spokesperson to urge extra caution in workplaces.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of new infections in Slovenia were transmitted locally, with multiple clusters across the country. A long-term care home in eastern Slovenia is a large hotspot with several residents and employees testing positive for COVID-19. Due to the increased number of infections in the country, Slovenia has been put on a list of countries for which restrictions apply upon entering Finland.  The Slovenian government has changed its criteria for categorizing countries according to its traffic light system (green, yellow, and red) for travel restrictions. The government will no longer only consider the number of infections per 100,000 people over a 14-day period, but will now also assess the possibility of infections spreading or being transmitted to other countries.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 20, Slovenia will issue quarantine orders to all Slovenian citizens and residents returning from countries with high infection rates via border crossings with Croatia. Montenegro and Luxembourg were placed on Slovenia’s quarantine list on July 17. Poland and the UK have been moved to the safe-country list alongside Austria, Belgium, Canada, and Spain. Some countries have gained or retained their epidemiologically-safe status despite a recent rise in cases due to reliable data and only a slight upward trend. On July 15, journalists and media workers gathered to protest against media reforms planned by the Slovenian government. The workers believe the proposed changes would undermine the public media’s independence and are critical of the government’s attempt to interfere with the media’s democratic role.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Slovenia, the government has re-introduced restrictions on public gatherings, with only 10 people now permitted. Official events of up to 50 people are still permitted but only if the organizer keeps a record of all the participants. Slovenia moved France and the Czech Republic back to their list of safe countries just two days after putting them on a list of countries whose citizens must quarantine on arrival. Residents of an eastern region of the Czech Republic remain on the quarantine list. Slovenian citizens and people with residence in Slovenia arriving from a quarantine-listed country do not need to be quarantined if they can prove property ownership or provide a bill for accommodation. The government had intended to implement a compulsory contact tracing app for those who have tested positive or those in quarantine. Failure to use the app would have resulted in a fine of 600 euros. Slovenia’s privacy watchdog, representatives from the Ministries of Health and Public Administration, and opposition parties all expressed their reservations about making the app mandatory. The opposition parties said the government should not use COVID-19 as a reason for excessive encroachment on human rights and civil liberties. On July 13, the Public Administration Minister addressed these concerns and announced that the app will be voluntary.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Croatia, France, and Czechia are no longer listed as COVID-19 safe countries based on new assessments by the Slovenian government. Citizens from these countries arriving in Slovenia must go into quarantine for 14 days but Slovenians returning from these countries are not required to. The municipality of Morav?e, north-east of Slovenia’s capital, has been in lockdown since July 2 after three cases were confirmed. The mayor has banned all public gatherings, made face masks mandatory, and placed strict measures on eateries in order to stop the spread. Despite an investigation into alleged wrongdoing in the procurement of medical supplies and PPE, the economy minister does not intend to resign. The prime minister sent a letter to the state prosecutor saying it is neglecting its legal role with respect to anti-government protests. The letter has been met with strong criticism, especially from the opposition, who cite it as another attack on independent institutions and an encroachment on the legislative branch of power. As a result, the opposition plans to initiate an impeachment motion against the prime minister.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 21, Slovenia had the highest number of daily infections since April 24--prompting several new government measures. In response, the government has made face masks mandatory in indoor public places and on public transportation. With most cases originating from abroad, the government has made adjustments to its list of COVID-19 safe countries from which arrivals face no restrictions. The government has placed Montenegro, Luxembourg, Albania and Portugal on the list of red countries from where entry to Slovenia involves a two week quarantine. The opposition is highly critical of the government’s crisis measures and the prime minister’s inappropriate and divisive rhetoric on social media towards the opposition and journalists.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective June 15, public gatherings up to 500 people were permitted in Slovenia and spectators could also attend sporting events again. The 500 person capacity limit at sporting events will include athletes, media, security and support staff. All safety recommendations issued by the National Institute of Public Health continue to apply. Slovenia began easing border and travel restrictions on May 15, but after a month the border fence between Italy and Slovenia was taken down because of significant disruptions for town residents. Restriction-free travel to European countries is permitted with controls in place for those arriving from countries deemed high risk, such as the UK and Sweden. Travellers coming from outside of Europe must quarantine for 14 days, including residents who have been outside of the EU for a two week period.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In efforts to improve domestic tourism, the government will be providing vouchers to all permanent residents of Slovenia as a part of a stimulus package. As of June 8, citizens from 17 EU and non-EU countries are permitted to enter Slovenia without restrictions under new border crossing rules, including Greece, Switzerland, and Norway. Citizens from Austria, Croatia, and Hungary have already been allowed to cross without health restrictions under bilateral agreements. Nationals from other EU and Schengen zone countries are still subject to a 14 day quarantine on arrival, unless they fall under one of the now 16 exemptions. Confirmation of tourist bookings is no longer considered an exemption. Continuous external pressure is adding to political instability and reducing citizens' trust in government amongst media reports that the primary reason for the announcement of the epidemic’s end in mid-May was because of public finances rather than public health.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Across Slovenia, most lockdown measures have been relaxed. Effective June 1, all hotels, fitness clubs and swimming pools reopened. Public gatherings of up to 200 people will also be permitted. The government ended the mandatory use of face coverings in public, but recommends their use in spaces where social distancing is not possible. On June 3, all primary school students will return to classes under strict hygiene guidelines and social distancing measures. A student tested positive, marking the first case among children after returning to school on May 18. The student’s classmates and teachers are in a two-week quarantine, but the remaining students at the school will continue attending classes. 1,000 police officers have been dispatched to Slovenia’s border with Croatia in efforts to tighten border controls and deter migrants and smugglers. The Health Minister told reporters that conditions at care homes need to be improved and additional health facilities need to be set up to properly provide for patients in the event of a second wave.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Kindergartens, primary schools for grades 1-3, and secondary schools for final year students have resumed, with the majority of eligible students being reported as having returned to school. All restaurants and stores are open but theatres across Slovenia remain closed. It is expected that theatres will be preparing to reopen with rehearsals in the coming weeks but are calling on the government to provide safety guidelines and an official timeline. With a phase reopening to neighbouring countries likely in the coming weeks, 17 news exemptions to the 14 day quarantine requirement for EU and Schengen zone nationals came into effect on May 26. Now, EU citizens can enter as tourists as long as they meet one of the exemptions. Exemptions include confirmation of booking, owning property, and commuting to work. In efforts to prevent another lockdown in the Fall, the Head of the Health Ministry Advisory Task Force, Bojana Beovic, said government efforts should be directed at testing and contact tracing to try to prepare for and delay a second wave. Efforts will also focus on mitigating staffing shortages by training additional essential personnel.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 15, the Slovenian government declared itself the first European country to have put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic within its borders. The Slovenian government will regularly publish a list of countries whose citizens can enter without restrictions based on the COVID-19 situation in surrounding countries. As of now, citizens of Croatia can freely enter without restrictions, and talks with other countries are underway.  The first passenger flights to and from Slovenia are expected to resume on May 26th. In an effort to boost the tourism sector, Slovenia will be giving each citizen a voucher of up to 200 EUR, small hotels with less than 30 rooms will be allowed to reopen, while larger hotels are expected to reopen within the next month. Public gatherings of more than 50 people remain banned, and citizens are obliged to follow social distancing measures and wear face masks in public spaces. On May 18, all shops, bars and restaurants were allowed to reopen. Students in their first three years of primary schools, and pupils in their final years of highschool will return to school - but most will continue online lessons for the rest of the year.</p>
