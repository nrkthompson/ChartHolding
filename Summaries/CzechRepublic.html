  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Police in Prague’s historic tourist district fired teargas and water cannons at protesters on October 18 after demonstrations against the country’s increasingly strict COVID-19 restrictions turned violent. Riot officers entered the Czech capital’s Old Town Square with horses and armoured vehicles after protesters among an estimated crowd of 2,000 began hurling projectiles and setting off firecrackers. The Czech Republic reported a record 11,105 cases on October 16, followed by another 8,713 on October 17. In the past week, bars and restaurants have been ordered to close, and schools have moved to distant learning. Sport and fitness clubs, theatres and cinemas have also closed, but shops remain open. Deputy Prime Minister has said that the country will wait until at least November 2 before deciding whether to order a full lockdown.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Czech Republic is on the brink of a second major lockdown as cases of COVID-19 continue to surge across the country. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has reported that new cases of COVID-19 in the past 14 days have totaled at least 55,538 - over 10,000 more than in neighbouring Germany. On October 12, the Czech government announced renewed restrictions across the country, all of which will last until at least November 3rd. All primary, secondary, and post-secondary schools are required to close from October 14, while kindergartens will stay open with special provisions made for the children of critical care workers. Restaurants will only be allowed to offer take-away services, and all pubs and bars must close. Indoor sports centres, such as gyms and pools, and cultural venues such as theatres, cinemas and museums, were required to close on October 12. Public gatherings are limited to six people, and mask-wearing will be mandatory in all places outside the home. Public consumption of alcohol will also be banned until November 4.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After reporting 3,793 new cases of COVID-19 on October 2, a second straight record for a single-day increase in cases, the Czech government announced its decision to implement a renewed state of emergency, starting October 5. It will last at least 30 days and enforce strict physical distancing by closing secondary schools in areas with a large number of infections, banning spectators from sports events, banning musicals and opera, and limiting the number of people allowed to participate in weddings. Indoor gatherings are currently being limited to a maximum of ten people, while outdoor gatherings can be held with up to twenty. These restrictions do not currently include gatherings such as weddings and funerals, which can still be held with up to 100 participants with appropriate safety measures in place. Masks have again been made mandatory at all times in all indoor and outdoor places outside of the home.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As new cases of COVID-19 continue to rise, many of the Czech Republic’s districts have advanced to a higher degree of alertness on the country’s regional alert system. As of September 21, the Prague region is at the “red” alert level, characterized by increasing or persistent community transmission, and a steadily increasing daily incidence of new COVID-19 cases. Mass gatherings in the Prague region are currently limited to 100 participants, and students of all levels in the region are prohibited from attending classes in person. Meanwhile, most of the country’s districts are at the “yellow” alert level, which is characterized by an increasing proportion of new cases for which the source of transmission is unclear, and a weekly incidence of about 30 cases per 100,000 people. Similarly to the Prague region, many districts at the yellow level are prohibited from holding events exceeding 100 participants, and students must attend classes remotely. At the national level, outdoor mass gatherings can currently take place with up to 1000 participants, or up to 2000 if the venue can be divided into sectors, while indoor mass gatherings can take place with up to 500 or 1000 participants respectively. If participants cannot be assigned a designated seat, these limits are reduced to 50 and 10 participants for outdoor and indoor events respectively. Catering establishments across the country are currently prohibited from operating between the hours of 22:00 and 6:00. On September 22, Prime Minister Andrej Babi_ appointed Roman Prymula as the country’s new health minister, one week after Adam Vojtech stepped down from the position.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As new cases of COVID-19 continue to rise across the Czech Republic, the countryís Health Minister unexpectedly announced his decision to step down on September 20 in order to ìcreate space for a solution to the COVID-19 pandemic.î The Czech Republic reported a record high of 3,130 new cases on September 17.  This is the countryís third straight daily record, comparable to the spread of the virus during the entire month of March. In response, the Czech government has ordered bars and nightclubs to close between 24:00 and 6:00, and has made face masks mandatory in classrooms for students over the age of 11. As of September 18, indoor mass events and gatherings exceeding 10 participants -- including bars and nightclubs -- can only be held if each attendee is assigned a specific seat.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a major resurgence in COVID-19 infections, the Czech government has decided to extend the compulsory use of masks beyond public transit, common areas of schools, and small buildings, as previously expected from September 1. On September 9, the Health Minister announced that†face masks will be required in all indoor spaces outside of home from September 10 until further notice. There are† 25 exceptions to that requirement, including when eating or drinking in restaurants, exercising in gyms, or working in an office environment where it is possible to maintain at least two meters of distance from others. Health officials have revealed that most areas of the Czech Republic will move from ìwhiteî (zero or negligible risk) to ìgreenî level (low-risk, preventative measures in effect) on the Health Ministryís regional COVID-19 map. Currently, Prague is the only region at the ìorange,î medium-risk level. As of September 10, the number of new COVID-19 infections in the Czech Republic has exceeded 1,000 for two days in a row, and has stayed above 400 new cases every day since the beginning of September. Before August 21, the highest number of COVID-19 cases reported on a single day was 377 on March 27.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 20, Czech Health Minister Adam Vojte?h reversed a previously announced decision that face masks would be required in nearly all indoor places across all Czech regions starting September 1. Based on the Ministry of Healthís most recent announcement, face masks will be mandatory in the Czech Republic from September 1 only while using public transport and while visiting public service offices and healthcare facilities. Despite previous reports, masks will not be mandatory in schools, shops, restaurants, hairdressers, or other service establishments ñ except in regions where the COVID-19 situation has been upgraded to a higher risk status that warrants such restrictions.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 17, the Prague and Fr˝dek-MÌstek regions remain in the green/low-risk zone of the Czech Ministry of Healthís regional COVID-19 risk map, while all other regions in the country have maintained no, or negligible, risk of infection. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has announced the governmentís decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory again in all Czech regions from September 1 while using public transport and while visiting many indoor venues. Public schools are expected to reopen on September 1, and students will be expected to wear masks in common areas of the school.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Czech Republic is experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.  The country confirmed 323 new cases on August 7 ñ its third highest daily increase since early March ñ and a record high of 5180 active cases as of August 10. Despite the resurgence in new infections, daily deaths have remained at a relatively low level, comparable to June and July.  As of August 4, the number of active hospitalizations was at a record low of 94. The Czech Ministry of Health has identified the Prague and Frydek-Mistek regions as the main areas of concern with respect to the virusís resurgence. It classified these regions as ìwithout the risk of community transmission, but with the occurrence of local outbreaksî (green level)--in contrast to the rest of the country, which has been classified as having ìzero risk of transmissionî (white level). Pragueís mayor announced on August 3 that wearing face masks in indoor public spaces is likely to once again become mandatory in Prague starting in September.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden and Tunisia ñ effective July 27 and August 3, respectively ñ are now among the countries considered by Czech health authorities to have a ìlow riskî of infection. This means that citizens travelling to the Czech Republic from either country will no longer have to provide a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival. Meanwhile, Romania was removed from the list of low-risk countries on August 3--meaning that foreigners travelling to the Czech Republic from Romania will now be required to submit a negative COVID-19 test prior to entering the country or else remain in self-isolation for at least 2 weeks.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Due to a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections throughout the Czech Republic, the Czech government has decided to reintroduce certain restrictions on mass gatherings until the countryís epidemiological situation improves. Effective July 25, Czech residents are again obliged to wear masks at all indoor events exceeding 100 participants. From July 27, all indoor events will be limited to 500 participants ñ decreased from the previous limit of 1000. This decision comes after a series of outbreaks occurred among participants at large indoor events, including over 100 infections connected to a nightclub in Prague. The Czech Minister of Health has stressed these measures are ìpreventive in nature,î and that they are being taken in order to avoid the need for more restrictive measures in the future. Latvia and Estonia have removed the Czech Republic from their respective lists of low-risk EU countries, which means that Czech citizens and residents will be required to undergo a two-week quarantine upon entry into either of these countries. 281 new infections were reported in the Czech Republic on Friday ñ the countryís highest daily increase since the end of June, bringing its total number of active infections to 5000.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 13, the government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiö approved the deployment of the Czech military to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The regulation - which will remain in effect until the end of 2020 - stipulates that a total of up to 68 soldiers in active service will be made available to the Czech Ministry of Health, regional hygienic stations, and health institutes. The 68 active members will be made up of 30 medics, 28 specialists from sampling teams, and 10 specialists from the ranks of analysts and coordinators. The Czech Republic has also changed its entry restrictions for non-married partners separated by travel bans throughout the EU. On July 20, it will be possible for third-country nationals ñ including those without visas ñ to visit their partners in the Czech Republic if they meet several conditions. This may include submitting evidence of their relationship ñ such as a joint lease agreement and/or bank account, or the birth certificate of common children.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 11, Serbia and Montenegro joined Sweden on the Czech Republicís list of ìredî (high-risk) countries from which travellers must submit a negative COVID-19 test prior to entering the country. Czech citizens and permanent residents can currently travel to and from over 30 ìgreenî (low-risk) countries without restrictions.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite experiencing a large spike in COVID-19 infections last week, the Czech government has continued easing restrictions related to the virus. Effective July 1, Czech residents are no longer required to wear a mask in public places, and all catering establishments can now accept customers between the hours of 11pm and 6am. Also starting July 1, mass gatherings - including various artistic performances, sporting events, religious services, and weddings - may take place with up to 1000 participants in both indoor and outdoor settings. As many as 305 cases of COVID-19 were reported on June 28, the countryís highest single-day increase since its peak of 381 cases on April 4.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 22, all hospitals, social service centres, and medical establishments throughout the Czech Republic were allowed to fully reopen for patients of all ages and target groups, subject to compliance with strict preventative measures. Mass gatherings - including all public and private festivals, performances, sporting events, religious services, and celebrations - can now take place with up to 1000 participants in both indoor and outdoor settings, provided that individuals are able to maintain at least 1.5 metres distance between each other at all times. All Czech residents are expected to cover their faces while in close proximity to other individuals--especially indoors, on public transit, and while participating in mass gatherings where they are unable to maintain a safe distance from other participants.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Czech government has continued easing COVID-19 restrictions this week and is focusing on reopening the countryís borders to travellers. Since June 15, citizens and long-term residents of selected EU+ countries have been allowed to travel to the Czech Republic without submitting a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival. These countries are selected based on a list maintained by the Czech Ministry of Health, which divides EU+ countries into three groups according to their level of risk relative to COVID-19. Travellers from ìlow-riskî countries, such as Spain and Italy,  can enter the country without restrictions, while those from ìmedium-riskî countries, such as Belgium and the UK, are required to submit a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival. Sweden and Portugal are currently the only two ìhigh-riskî countries whose citizens are completely banned from entry.All public gatherings and private events, including festivals, religious services, sporting events, and weddings, can take place with up to 500 participants in both indoor and outdoor settings. Large indoor establishments, such as museums, galleries, theatres, and concert halls, are also permitted to admit up to 500 participants at once, provided that a safe distancing can be maintained. A state-endorsed contract-tracing app, called ìeRouska.cz,î has been available to Czech residents for voluntary use on Android and iOS devices since June 11. All Czech residents are expected to cover their faces while in close proximity to other individuals, especially indoors, and on public transit.</p>
