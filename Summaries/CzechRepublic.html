  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Czech government has continued easing COVID-19 restrictions this week and is focusing on reopening the country’s borders to travellers. Since June 15, citizens and long-term residents of selected EU+ countries have been allowed to travel to the Czech Republic without submitting a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival. These countries are selected based on a list maintained by the Czech Ministry of Health, which divides EU+ countries into three groups according to their level of risk relative to COVID-19. Travellers from “low-risk” countries, such as Spain and Italy,  can enter the country without restrictions, while those from “medium-risk” countries, such as Belgium and the UK, are required to submit a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival. Sweden and Portugal are currently the only two “high-risk” countries whose citizens are completely banned from entry.All public gatherings and private events, including festivals, religious services, sporting events, and weddings, can take place with up to 500 participants in both indoor and outdoor settings. Large indoor establishments, such as museums, galleries, theatres, and concert halls, are also permitted to admit up to 500 participants at once, provided that a safe distancing can be maintained. A state-endorsed contract-tracing app, called “eRouska.cz,” has been available to Czech residents for voluntary use on Android and iOS devices since June 11. All Czech residents are expected to cover their faces while in close proximity to other individuals, especially indoors, and on public transit.</p>
