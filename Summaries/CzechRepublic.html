  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 17, the Prague and Frýdek-Místek regions remain in the green/low-risk zone of the Czech Ministry of Health’s regional COVID-19 risk map, while all other regions in the country have maintained no, or negligible, risk of infection. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has announced the government’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory again in all Czech regions from September 1 while using public transport and while visiting many indoor venues. Public schools are expected to reopen on September 1, and students will be expected to wear masks in common areas of the school.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Czech Republic is experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.  The country confirmed 323 new cases on August 7 – its third highest daily increase since early March – and a record high of 5180 active cases as of August 10. Despite the resurgence in new infections, daily deaths have remained at a relatively low level, comparable to June and July.  As of August 4, the number of active hospitalizations was at a record low of 94. The Czech Ministry of Health has identified the Prague and Frydek-Mistek regions as the main areas of concern with respect to the virus’s resurgence. It classified these regions as “without the risk of community transmission, but with the occurrence of local outbreaks” (green level)--in contrast to the rest of the country, which has been classified as having “zero risk of transmission” (white level). Prague’s mayor announced on August 3 that wearing face masks in indoor public spaces is likely to once again become mandatory in Prague starting in September.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden and Tunisia – effective July 27 and August 3, respectively – are now among the countries considered by Czech health authorities to have a “low risk” of infection. This means that citizens travelling to the Czech Republic from either country will no longer have to provide a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival. Meanwhile, Romania was removed from the list of low-risk countries on August 3--meaning that foreigners travelling to the Czech Republic from Romania will now be required to submit a negative COVID-19 test prior to entering the country or else remain in self-isolation for at least 2 weeks.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Due to a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections throughout the Czech Republic, the Czech government has decided to reintroduce certain restrictions on mass gatherings until the country’s epidemiological situation improves. Effective July 25, Czech residents are again obliged to wear masks at all indoor events exceeding 100 participants. From July 27, all indoor events will be limited to 500 participants – decreased from the previous limit of 1000. This decision comes after a series of outbreaks occurred among participants at large indoor events, including over 100 infections connected to a nightclub in Prague. The Czech Minister of Health has stressed these measures are “preventive in nature,” and that they are being taken in order to avoid the need for more restrictive measures in the future. Latvia and Estonia have removed the Czech Republic from their respective lists of low-risk EU countries, which means that Czech citizens and residents will be required to undergo a two-week quarantine upon entry into either of these countries. 281 new infections were reported in the Czech Republic on Friday – the country’s highest daily increase since the end of June, bringing its total number of active infections to 5000.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 13, the government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš approved the deployment of the Czech military to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The regulation - which will remain in effect until the end of 2020 - stipulates that a total of up to 68 soldiers in active service will be made available to the Czech Ministry of Health, regional hygienic stations, and health institutes. The 68 active members will be made up of 30 medics, 28 specialists from sampling teams, and 10 specialists from the ranks of analysts and coordinators. The Czech Republic has also changed its entry restrictions for non-married partners separated by travel bans throughout the EU. On July 20, it will be possible for third-country nationals – including those without visas – to visit their partners in the Czech Republic if they meet several conditions. This may include submitting evidence of their relationship – such as a joint lease agreement and/or bank account, or the birth certificate of common children.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 11, Serbia and Montenegro joined Sweden on the Czech Republic’s list of “red” (high-risk) countries from which travellers must submit a negative COVID-19 test prior to entering the country. Czech citizens and permanent residents can currently travel to and from over 30 “green” (low-risk) countries without restrictions.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite experiencing a large spike in COVID-19 infections last week, the Czech government has continued easing restrictions related to the virus. Effective July 1, Czech residents are no longer required to wear a mask in public places, and all catering establishments can now accept customers between the hours of 11pm and 6am. Also starting July 1, mass gatherings - including various artistic performances, sporting events, religious services, and weddings - may take place with up to 1000 participants in both indoor and outdoor settings. As many as 305 cases of COVID-19 were reported on June 28, the country’s highest single-day increase since its peak of 381 cases on April 4.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 22, all hospitals, social service centres, and medical establishments throughout the Czech Republic were allowed to fully reopen for patients of all ages and target groups, subject to compliance with strict preventative measures. Mass gatherings - including all public and private festivals, performances, sporting events, religious services, and celebrations - can now take place with up to 1000 participants in both indoor and outdoor settings, provided that individuals are able to maintain at least 1.5 metres distance between each other at all times. All Czech residents are expected to cover their faces while in close proximity to other individuals--especially indoors, on public transit, and while participating in mass gatherings where they are unable to maintain a safe distance from other participants.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Czech government has continued easing COVID-19 restrictions this week and is focusing on reopening the country’s borders to travellers. Since June 15, citizens and long-term residents of selected EU+ countries have been allowed to travel to the Czech Republic without submitting a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival. These countries are selected based on a list maintained by the Czech Ministry of Health, which divides EU+ countries into three groups according to their level of risk relative to COVID-19. Travellers from “low-risk” countries, such as Spain and Italy,  can enter the country without restrictions, while those from “medium-risk” countries, such as Belgium and the UK, are required to submit a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival. Sweden and Portugal are currently the only two “high-risk” countries whose citizens are completely banned from entry.All public gatherings and private events, including festivals, religious services, sporting events, and weddings, can take place with up to 500 participants in both indoor and outdoor settings. Large indoor establishments, such as museums, galleries, theatres, and concert halls, are also permitted to admit up to 500 participants at once, provided that a safe distancing can be maintained. A state-endorsed contract-tracing app, called “eRouska.cz,” has been available to Czech residents for voluntary use on Android and iOS devices since June 11. All Czech residents are expected to cover their faces while in close proximity to other individuals, especially indoors, and on public transit.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 25, the Czech government proceeded to the fourth and final phase of its reopening plan, allowing all catering establishments, hotels, spas, and public swimming pools to resume business, subject to detailed sanitary guidelines.

On June 5, Prime Minister Andrej Babis announced substantial changes to land border restrictions with a number of European countries. Czech citizens, as well temporary and permanent residents of the Czech Republic, will no longer have to undergo a mandatory quarantine period or submit a negative COVID-19 test upon entering the country. Citizens and residents of Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, and Germany - as well as EU citizens with a certificate of temporary or permanent residence in any of these countries - are also permitted to enter the republic without a mandatory quarantine period or negative COVID-19 test. Other activities and business operations are expected to resume throughout the month of June.</p>
