      Negotiations between the Danish government and opposition parties have been ongoing for the past few weeks as Denmark aims to gradually return to normal lie. As part of its plan, Denmark has announced that all Danish adults will have the opportunity to be tested for coronavirus, including those who have no symptoms. While the program will only be open to 18-to-25 year olds initially, it will gradually be expanded to all age groups in the coming months. A clarification on the age range was issued after tens of thousands of Danes attempted to make an appointment on the government’s online service, only to be told they were ineligible. Denmark’s virus reproduction rate has remained below 1 since its initial stage of reopening, staying between 0.6 and 0.9 even as restrictions have loosened. The government and opposition came to an agreement that moved up some aspects of the reopening plan, allowing cultural institutions to open on May 21st and expanding the list of reasons a foreigner could enter Denmark to allow for visiting relatives and checking on second homes (only available to Nordic residents and Germans). The government has promised to release a plan for the tourism industry by May 29th after business leaders and members of the opposition have criticized the lack of clarity over border controls.
