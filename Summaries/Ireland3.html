      With Ireland entering the second phase of its reopening strategy on June 8, a number of restrictions are planned to be lifted, including allowing four people to visit a household and meet outdoors for a short period of time, while maintaining strict social distancing rules. Small number of retail outlets with minimal staff are allowed to reopen, with limited capacity and a distance of 1.5m maintained between the customers. Travelling of up to 20km away from home is permitted with the maintenance of social distancing measures and other guidelines in place. Individuals aged 70 and above are allowed to exercise for a short period of time with retail hours coordinated across all retailers for them, with strict social distancing measures such as the provision of gloves and application of face coverings in place. Visits to homes of over 70s and the medically vulnerable are allowed by a small number of people for a short period of time, while wearing gloves, face coverings and maintaining a strict 2m physical distance. Creches and pre-schools also reopened, with primary and secondary schools scheduled to reopen in late August.
