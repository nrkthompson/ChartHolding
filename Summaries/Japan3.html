      South Korea has been wrestling with a resurgence of cases since the beginning of May with major outbreaks in nightclubs and a logistics center. The government is planning to use test quick response (QR) code-based entry logs across a variety of facilities including nightclubs, eateries, cinemas and churches starting this week, before expanding it to include high-risk facilities across the country so they can better track the virus. Importing remdesivir is being pursued as an emergency treatment for critically ill patients. Enhanced epidemic control measures were implemented on May 28 for the Seoul Metropolitan Region and will remain until June 14. Facilities, such as bars, singing rooms and PC cafes are recommended to close and might be subject to a gathering ban. Companies have been recommended to incorporate telecommuting and flexible work schedules. Residents are urged to refrain from social gathering or visiting places frequented by many people. No further restrictive measures have been reintroduced nationwide and most businesses continue to operate following everyday infection prevention practices. More students returned to in-person classes on June 3 despite widespread concerns over infections in schools, leaving only students in the first grade of middle school and higher grades of elementary school studying virtually. Businesses frequented by teenagers are strongly advised to remain closed until June 14.
