      Latvia’s nationwide state of emergency will remain in effect until as early as June 9, but many of its more restrictive measures are being gradually lifted. As of May 7, gatherings of up to 25 people were allowed, provided that individuals could maintain at least 2 metres of distance between each other. Latvia’s Minister of Health has said that after June 9, this limit could be increased to 50 for indoor gatherings and possibly up to 200 for outdoor gatherings. Religious services are being allowed to take place subject to sanitary protocols, while weddings, baptisms, and funerals can be organized with up to 25 guests. Despite extending its state of emergency, the Latvian government decided on May 21 that citizens from the EU and Switzerland would be allowed to enter and leave the Republic of Latvia, effective immediately. Arrivals are still required to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry. Developed collaboratively by various members of Latvia’s IT industry, a contact tracing application called Apturi Covid (Stop Covid) was released to the Latvian public for voluntary use on May 29. A number of Latvian officials, including the Prime Minister, have downloaded and publicly endorsed the application in order to encourage its widespread use. Latvia’s state of emergency has been extended twice since it was first announced on March 13; Prime Minister Krišj?nis Kari?š has said that the latest extension is likely to be the last.
