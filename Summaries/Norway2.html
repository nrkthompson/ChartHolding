      Travel restrictions will remain in place for the next few months, as the government has rejected the request of a Swedish border town for its residents to be exempt from quarantine rules when crossing the border. Norway has advised its citizens to refrain from international travel for the rest of the summer and will not remove any border restrictions until at least June 15. Schools in Norway will largely return to normal next week after the government allowed whole classes to be taught together during normal operating hours. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has issued a report saying that lockdown measures in the country were likely unnecessary by the time they were implemented. The Director of the Institute has said that releasing this report was important to raise questions about the effectiveness of locking down in the event of a second wave later this year. PM Solberg has agreed with the report’s conclusions, though she has said that she believes that the government was right to implement a lockdown at the time.
