      France's COVID-19 death toll remained less than 100 for the seventh in a row on May 27th. As well, ICU patients dropped by 54 to 1,555, continuing the downward trend, which is a key indicator for the government to continue reopening its economy. After reopening schools in mid-May, more than 50 have closed due to new COVID-19 outbreaks. There must be no more than 15 children in a class, no shared toys, and timed arrivals at school, and students over the age of 11 must wear masks. Although most primary schools have reopened, only one in five primary school students have returned to class since it is not yet compulsory for parents to send their children back to school. The government is encouraging the population to download a tracking app called StopCovid, which uses Bluetooth to trace when a phone is in proximity to others who have contracted the virus, without geolocating users. On May 28th, the PM announced that bars, restaurants, cafés, parks, and beaches could reopen with restrictions from June 2nd. Paris is now deemed an “orange” zone, allowing the region to loosen some restrictions on gatherings. Junior high schools and high schools will be able to reopen “faster than expected.” Finally, the country will welcome European tourists as of June 15th. The PM said that restrictions would be reintroduced if there are more than 50 daily cases for seven consecutive days in a region.
