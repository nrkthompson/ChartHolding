      Despite a decline in the daily average of new COVID-19 cases, Swiss experts predict a second wave of infections. Experts have said that contact tracing is the most effective strategy for breaking transmission and controlling the spread. In mid-June, MPs will debate the use of Apple and Googleâ€™s contract tracing application before it is offered to the general public. As of May 30, public gatherings of 30 people will be permitted again, up from a previous limit of 5, followed by public and private events up to 300 people on June 6. The government will decide whether or not to lift a ban on events up to 1,000 people at the end of June. Also, summer camps, zoos, cinemas, theatres, and leisure facilities will reopen on June 8. In efforts to free up travel within the Schengen zone, the Swiss government plans to restore free movement with other  member countries by July 6. After reaffirming its plans with Germany, Austria, and France to lift all travel restrictions on June 15, Switzerland is advising citizens to avoid Italy until further steps can be coordinated in the coming weeks. Travel into Switzerland from outside the Schengen zone may not be possible until mid-July. The COVID-19 crisis has led to increased unity in Swiss Parliament over the need to re-industrialize the economy. Politicians from across the political spectrum are agreeing that substantial changes need to be made to avoid relying on other countries and international supply chains.
