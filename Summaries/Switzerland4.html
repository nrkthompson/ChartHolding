Camping sites, pools, and leisure facilities have reopened and summer camps can resume with a maximum of 300 children,  as long as attendance is kept. Middle schools, vocational schools, and universities have reopened and all sports can resume except those that are high contact. The Swiss soccer Super League can resume with groups of up to 1,000 people allowed at sporting events beginning in July. In eateries, groups larger than 4 will be able to sit together, but will be required to register each attendee upon arrival. 2 metres distance between each table remains mandatory. Nightclubs will reopen, but establishments must adhere to distancing and hygiene rules which include a 300 person maximum, 2 metre distancing between patrons and a midnight curfew. Public gatherings of up to 300 people are permitted as long as a 2 metre distance is maintained. Demonstrators will need to apply for a permit and explain how they plan to minimize the spread.90 On June 15, Swiss borders will reopen to Germany, Austria, and France. On July 6, Switzerland plans to reopen borders with other Schengen zone countries.
