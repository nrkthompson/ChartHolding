On June 3, Latvia’s Cabinet of Ministers expanded the list of countries from which travellers may enter Latvia without a mandatory quarantine period upon arrival. Latvian nationals, permanent residents, and foreigners who have not visited countries other than Latvia, Lithuania, or Estonia in the last 14 days, can now enter Latvia from over 30 countries, including Italy, France, and Germany. Developed collaboratively by various members of Latvia’s IT industry, a contact tracing application called Apturi Covid (Stop Covid) was released to the Latvian public for voluntary use on May 29. A number of Latvian officials, including the Prime Minister, have downloaded and publicly endorsed the application in order to encourage its widespread use.
