      After suspending all international flights on March 28, amid COVID-19-related travel restrictions worldwide, Turkey announced the resumption of international flights to 40 countries on June 10. The resumption of flights began with flights to the Netherlands, Germany and London on June 11 and will be followed by flights to Belgium and France on June 15, and later Austria on June 16. Resumption of  domestic flights began on June 1. Passenger entry into the terminals is regulated with temperature checks at the entrance and only allows passengers with valid tickets to enter. Social distancing is required for passengers and airport personnel. After a week of easing lockdown measures, there was a surge of COVID-19 cases in Diyarbak?r, one of the biggest cities in Turkey’s southeast region, so the  health authorities increased the number of COVID-19 clinics in the city from one to five and launched two pandemic hospitals. Diyarbak?r’s Governor  announced on June 8, that the city’s residents must wear masks in public effective June 10. He lamented that the city was not at the desired level of mask use or social distancing which contributed to an increase in the number of positive cases. Several neighborhoods and districts in the city are already under lockdown after a large number of cases emerged this week.
