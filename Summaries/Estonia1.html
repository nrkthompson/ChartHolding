      The state of emergency in Estonia came to an end this week as most lockdown restrictions in the country were lifted, though some social distancing protocols remain. Most cultural and recreational institutions will reopen on June 1st, and the sale of alcohol after 10pm will also be permitted. A complete list of regulations for crossing the border were revealed for those from Baltic states and Finland, who need to provide a sufficient reason for entering Estonia. The government’s controversial Emergency Act has provoked the ire of the President of Estonia, who publicly rebuked the governing party for fast-tracking the bill through parliament and not addressing the concerns of citizens. Critics have said that the bill gives too much power over emergency situations to state agencies, and reduces the role that the legislature plays in responding to crises. Despite these concerns, the government has stated that it is unlikely to amend the bill prior to the fall in the event of a second wave of infections.
