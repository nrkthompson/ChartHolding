      Restrictions related to COVID-19 continue to be eased throughout Hungary after its Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly dubbed the country’s response to COVID-19, “the most successful in Europe.”  All eateries are allowed to complete sales and seat customers indoors, and all religious services, funerals, and weddings are being permitted. Post-secondary academic institutions have been allowed to reopen, subject to the individual decisions of their respective deans or directors. The Hungarian government has also continued to ease land border restrictions with neighboring countries demonstrating favourable epidemiological situations. Since May 22nd, no Austrian or Hungarian citizen with a negative coronavirus test taken in the last 4 days has been required to undergo a mandatory quarantine period upon entering Hungary, while Serbian citizens have been allowed to enter Hungary without restrictions since May 25th. On May 27th, the borders between Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic were reopened, with citizens being permitted to travel across each respective border for up to 48 hours at a time without a mandatory quarantine period. Guidelines related to personal hygiene and physical distancing continue to apply to all Hungarian residents until further notice.
