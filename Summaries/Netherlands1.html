      After the government announced a 5 phase plan on reopening the Netherlands, effective May 11th, Amsterdam's mayor objected to the equal implementation of easing policies within all regions. She suggested that easing policies be implemented slowly within regions where the population is more dense, as a second outbreak would most  likely result if steps were taken too swiftly. On May 19th, the PM defended his stance of having a single national plan and confirmed that the second phase of the reopening plan would come into effect on June 1st.  Restaurants and bars will be able to reopen after 12 pm, with up to 30 guests, given that they adhere to the 1.5 metre distance rule. Cinemas and museums will be able to reopen under strict social distancing rules, with limited capacity in halls. All public transport users will be required to wear masks, as traffic will get busier with every reopening stage. High schools will reopen by June 2nd and elementary schools will return to full schedules by June 8th. Care homes will be permitted to have visitors again on May 25th, as more widespread testing will be available to reduce risks. The PM also signaled an increase in the number of visitors to the elderly homes by June 15th,  upon successful testing in the previous stage. Mucus swab testing for active COVID-19 infections will also become more widely available in June, with those testing positive to be quarantined. Gyms and dance venues  remain closed, with large sporting events banned until September.
