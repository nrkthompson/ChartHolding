      On May 20th, the Slovak government proceeded to the fourth and final stage of its plan for easing restrictions related to COVID-19. All shopping centers have been allowed to reopen, provided that they are able to maintain at least 15m2 distance between shoppers, while cinemas, theatres, and other mass gatherings are being allowed to take place with up to 100 participants. Indoor and outdoor eateries are being allowed to accept customers with a maximum of two patrons per table, while maintaining a distance of 2 metres between each table. Public sports grounds, fitness centres, and swimming pools have all been allowed to reopen without the use of change rooms and showers. General guidelines on hygiene and physical distancing, such as the obligatory use of facemasks in all public places, continue to apply to most residents. On May 24th, the Slovak government announced the release of its contact tracing app, eKaranténa, available on all Android smartphones. Effective immediately, everyone arriving at Slovakia’s border looking to enter or travel throughout the country is required to download and register for the application. iPhone users will be able to download the application after its official approval by Apple.
