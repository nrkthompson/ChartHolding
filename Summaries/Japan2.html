      While prefectural authorities continue to make their own decisions over reopening, Japan’s national government ended its nationwide state of emergency on May 25 - thus lifting many of the most restrictive measures introduced in response to COVID-19. Cultural events such as concerts and exhibitions are being allowed to take place with a limited number of attendees, while karaoke parlors and gyms will reopen on June 1 with strict hygienic guidelines in place. Live music venues and nightlife establishments are being asked to remain closed. Professional sporting events will be allowed to  take place without spectators from June 19, while fans are expected to be welcomed back in July. Students are physically returning to school at a staggered pace. Regular bullet train services have been scheduled to resume from as early as June 1with limited capacity. Border control measures - such as visa restrictions - have been extended to the end of June. 111 countries and regions are currently banned from entering Japan. Restrictions will continue to be eased over 3 week intervals, subject to the country’s ongoing epidemiological situation.
