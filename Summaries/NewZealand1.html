      On May 19, New Zealand’s government released a contact tracing app that allows users to log the places they have recently visited. On May 13, a bill was passed - under intense scrutiny from the Opposition - that would allow New Zealand’s Health Minister to legally enforce alert level rules after lifting the country’s state of emergency. Residents are now being allowed to visit stores, malls, cafés, restaurants, bars, and other public spaces. Contact records will no longer be a requirement for retailers. The number of people allowed to gather in one place has been limited to 10. Children are returning to school (with the attendance rate at about 80%), and early learning centers were allowed to open on May 18 - subject to strict physical distancing and hygiene rules. As both countries see promising trends in terms of control over the virus, New Zealand and Australia will proceed to establish a trans-Tasman travel “bubble” if deemed safe.
