      More counties in Washington entered phase 2 and reopened outdoor recreation, dine-in restaurants, gyms and personal care services. Washington DC will remain in phase 1 following an increase in cases on June 1. After forming a public-private partnership with Home Depot and Publix, Florida will open more testing sites. Texas enters phase 3 with larger gatherings and more activities. Only some Texas school districts decided to reopen. In response to the George Floyd protests, California and Florida have temporarily closed some testing sites.
