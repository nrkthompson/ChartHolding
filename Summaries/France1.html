      Hospitalisations in France continue to fall, which is the benchmark the Government is using to continue reopening the economy. Based on mathematical models, top health experts are not expecting a second wave anytime soon. Nonetheless, the Government has yet to firmly decide when borders, hotels, restaurants, and cafes will fully reopen. Last week PM Phillippe announced a €18 billion rescue plan for the tourism sector, with businesses up to 20 employees being able to access grants up to €10,000. As the lockdown is lifted and the weather is clearing up, the country has reported a 44% increase in the use of bicycles as a mode of transportation. A few days after reopening schools, a worrying flareup of about 70 cases was linked to this policy measure. Affected schools are being closed immediately, mostly in northern France and Paris. According to the original reopening plan announced on April 28th, on June 2nd cafes, restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres, and big museums, including the Louvre, will reopen. However, PM Phillippe announced this week that this is not guaranteed, and he will announce confirmed reopenings on May 25th. Although gatherings of more than 10 people are banned, infamous Yellow Vest protests began on May 16th, the first weekend after confinement restrictions were eased. Police broke up gatherings ranging from 50 to 350 protestors in  Bordeaux,  Paris,  Lyon, and Montpellier.
