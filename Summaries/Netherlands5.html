      Effective June 15, shared toilets and ablution facilities belonging to outdoor and high-performance sports centers, zoos, amusement parks, public swimming pools and public libraries opened to the public, along with major educational institutions. Lecture halls are allowed to fill up to a maximum capacity of 20 percent in universities, with classes set to run between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m, and then again after 8 p.m. to avoid rush hour congestion. On the following day, travel advice to 16 European countries also relaxed to the public, with holiday trips allowed to most EU countries. The advice went from code orange, which discourages all unnecessary trips, to code yellow, which warns of safety risks to travelers. Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Ireland are not yet among code yellow countries. An  entry ban to the  people arriving from outside the EU is also extended until July 1. However, the ban is not applicable to EU citizens, and their family members. Holders of a residency permit or long-stay visas for the Netherlands, people with vital functions, such as healthcare- and border workers, people employed in transportation of goods, and even diplomats and military personnel, are also exempted from the ban.
