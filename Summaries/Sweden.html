  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden’s healthcare watchdog has reported that some residents of long-term care homes did not receive appropriate healthcare in the midst of the pandemic. After strict restrictions on long-term care homes were issued by some municipalities, some homes reported that they were unable to let doctors in to assess individual residents. Nearly half of all Swedish deaths from COVID-19 occurred in long-term care homes. Starting on July 15, Sweden will update its travel advice every two weeks. Swedes are currently able to travel to 14 countries in the EU; advice against non-essential travel is still in place for all other European countries. With a few exceptions, all countries exempted from the advice do not have quarantine requirements in place for Swedish travellers.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Restaurants, bars, and cafes in Sweden must now guarantee that each group of patrons has at least one metre of distance between themselves and adjacent groups. Members of the same group from different households should also have at least an arm’s length between them. The new restriction comes as local councils have taken over enforcement of restrictions against overcrowding at eateries, empowering them to issue shutdown orders. Sweden will exempt all countries on the EU’s safe third country list from its ban on entry by travellers from non-EU/EEA countries, which was recently extended to August 31. A law that granted the Swedish government emergency powers expired on June 30 without ever being used. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has fought back against the WHO’s assessment of Sweden as a country that is at ‘special risk’ of COVID-19, saying that it was a ‘total misinterpretation’ of Swedish case numbers and testing figures. The WHO’s European branch later acknowledged that Sweden had made progress, but said that the infection rate remained very high.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden has extended the country’s ban on travellers from outside the EU/EEA until July 7. Exceptions apply to EU citizens, Swedish residents, and those working in essential services. Amusement parks in Sweden will not be able to obtain an exemption from gathering limits (the current limit is 50) for the entire summer season, forcing virtually all operations to cease. Park operators were hoping to acquire the same status as zoos, which are not covered under the Ordinance Act’s guidelines on gathering limits. Sweden will appoint an independent commission to investigate the country’s response to the pandemic, which plans to complete its review before the next election in 2022. Swedes appear to be losing confidence in the government’s ability to deal with COVID-19: an Ipsos poll showed for the first time that less than a majority of respondents have ‘strong confidence’ in the government’s response to the pandemic.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In one of the few legal restrictions that the government imposed, Sweden has extended its ban on visits to long-term care homes from June 30 until August 31 as the infection rate in the country remains high. In line with a recommendation from the European Commission, Sweden extended its ban on travel from non-EU/EEA countries until June 30, with some exemptions for essential workers. Furthermore, Sweden will scrap its recommendations against non-essential travel to 10 European countries from June 30. Notably, the list only includes countries that do not have any travel restrictions on Swedish citizens, and therefore does not include Norway, Denmark or Finland. The recommendation against travel to all other EU/EEA countries will be in place until July 15, and to all non-EU/EEA countries until August 31. While not a legally enforceable ban, the recommendation means that non-essential travel will not be covered by travel insurance.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden will lift all of its recommendations on limiting domestic travel on June 13. The government had previously recommended that asymptomatic people limit their travel to a one-to-two hour car ride away from their home. While those from outside the EU/EEA are still not allowed to enter Sweden, several clarifications have been made about exemptions to the rule. Immediate family members (spouse, partner or child) of Swedish citizens and residents will now be allowed to enter the country. The exemption applies even if the person does not have an “established home” in Sweden, as was previously the case. Extended family members cannot visit family in Sweden if they are not an EU/EEA citizen, though exceptions can be made in individual cases. Foreign seasonal workers in agriculture, forestry and horticulture industries will also be permitted to enter the country from June 8. Swedish police have said that they will be stricter in granting permits for demonstrations after a number of anti-racism protests around the country violated the gathering limit of 50 people.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In a radio interview, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has admitted that Sweden should have committed itself to a more restrictive lockdown strategy than what was undertaken. Tegnell later backtracked his remarks in the interview, saying that he stands by Sweden’s strategy as a whole but that there is room for improvement. These statements come after Tegnell has been defiant against criticism of the country’s strategy, while insisting that Sweden’s approach was more sustainable than the harsh lockdowns undertaken elsewhere. PM Lofven bowed to opposition party pressure to appoint an independent commission to investigate the country’s COVID-19 response before the summer begins, after previously expressing his desire to wait until the pandemic is over. Nearly 8000 people gathered at an anti-racism protest in Stockholm on June 3, which was eventually broken up by police due to the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. Organizers were initially given permission for the protest to go ahead, but the crowd size swelled rapidly. The government issued a statement that said it gave permission for the protest because it is the organizer’s responsibility to ensure their event meets social distancing guidelines, but it became clear that they lost control of the crowd and police were needed to maintain the 50-person limit. The government has also announced changes to its testing strategy, with any person with symptoms able to get tested (rather than a priority system) and the resumption of contact tracing for all those who test positive. Health Minister Lena Hallengren did not specify when this policy would be implemented, and said that it would be up to each region how they opt to test their population.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Officials in the Skåne region have outlined their plan to increase the amount of testing in the region by offering tests to those working in non-healthcare essential services, and to those who require medical treatment of any kind, even if they do not need to go to the hospital. The Minister of Health Lena Hallengren is facing criticism after nearly 5000 fewer people were tested last week than the week before, and the country is still significantly below its testing capacity of 100,000. Hallengren has said that it was naive to place that high of a testing goal, and she acknowledged the logistical challenges that have made it so difficult to reach. In a separate interview, Hallengren said that she believes that Swedes have largely been following the government’s recommendations, but acknowledged the high number of infections in long-term care homes. Opposition parties have scheduled debates in Parliament over the government’s handling of the situation in long-term care homes, after previously supporting the government’s strategy.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite its distinct approach to lockdown measures, business leaders in Sweden have said that the voluntary measures will not save them from the economic collapse felt in other countries. Sweden has extended its entry ban to those from outside Europe to June 15th, with exceptions for healthcare workers, supply chain reasons or urgent family matters. The ban does not apply to those seeking asylum, or foreign seasonal workers in essential businesses. The Swedish government has said it is in dialogue with Denmark to open their mutual border after expressing disapproval at Danish intentions to open its border to every other Nordic country. Other Nordic countries have also expressed their reservations at including Sweden in a potential Nordic travel bubble due to the much higher rate of infection among Swedes. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has said that domestic travel restrictions will likely be loosened at some point this summer, though he did not specify when. Sweden will expand testing to those experiencing only mild symptoms, as well as those working in critical services, though a doctor’s approval is still needed to acquire a test.</p>
