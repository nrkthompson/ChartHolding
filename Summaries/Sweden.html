  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of COVID-19 patients in Sweden who have been admitted to the ICU has doubled in the last three weeks. Due to a rising infection rate across the country, the Swedish government has decided to postpone a planned expansion of the gathering limit for public seated events until at least October 15. Bars, restaurants, and cafes will be permitted to cater to more than the current gathering limit of 50 people from October 8. Public health officials announced that people who live in the same household as an infected person must self-isolate with them until they recover. Those who have recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months, have antibodies, or attend a special needs school are exempt from the restriction. Sweden’s top public health official said that the country’s COVID-19 restrictions will likely remain in place for at least the next year, and local restrictions may be implemented in the coming months.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chief Epidemiologist Tegnell and Prime Minister Lofven urged Swedes to continue following the government’s recommendations, especially working from home, after the infection rate in Sweden rose over the past week. Public health officials said that movement patterns in the country indicate that residents have largely returned to work despite the recommendations. New restrictions may be put in place in the Stockholm area, but it is unclear what form they would take. The health minister said it is unlikely that the Swedish government will move forward with its expansion of the gathering limit for public events, scheduled to take effect on October 1, although the delay has not been confirmed.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden will lift its nationwide ban on visits to long-term care facilities on October 1. The ban was introduced on April 1 after COVID-19 outbreaks occurred at the facilities throughout the country. Since the ban was introduced, infection and fatality rates in the facilities have dropped precipitously. The ban was one of the few national restrictions introduced by the Swedish government throughout the pandemic. Sweden lifted its recommendation against non-essential travel to the UK after the UK did the same for Sweden. The Swedish government also lifted its restrictions on travel to Finland and Slovakia. Public health officials will shift to updating their COVID-19 statistics four times a week rather than every weekday. State Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said that Swedenís excess COVID-19 fatality rate was due to a mild flu season in recent years. After his Norwegian counterpart pushed back against this idea, Tegnell said that it was too early to make a definitive determination on the source of the high number of deaths.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Public health officials warned Swedes that some self-testing kits have been linked to nearly 4000 false positive tests in the country since the beginning of the pandemic. The test kits were unable to distinguish between low levels of COVID-19 and negative samples. The Public Health Agency approved the Swedish governmentís plan to allow some seated events of up to 500 people to take place from October 1. Organizers must comply with social distancing regulations, and further restrictions may be implemented for larger events. However, Swedish police said they would have difficulty monitoring compliance with restrictions if only certain events are permitted to take place. Police officials suggested allowing all events at a lower maximum to take place to more effectively perform inspections. Sweden met its COVID-19 testing goal for the first time last week, carrying out over 100,000 tests. The goal had been set in mid-April, but various delays pushed back efforts to reach 100,000. The governmentís advice against non-essential travel to the EU has been extended until September 23 -- and until November 15 for non-EU countries.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Swedish government said that it was considering an exemption to the countryís 50-person gathering limit for some seated events. Any exemption applied to sporting events or performances would only occur if social distancing is guaranteed. These events would still be subject to a maximum number of people, though an exact number has not yet been released. The government plans to implement these exemptions on October 1, but is announcing the change now so as to allow companies enough time to prepare. The private gathering limit of 50 people is expected to remain in place indefinitely. The Head of the Swedish Public Health Agency said that authorities may still recommend the use of face masks in the future, but will not do so now due to fears of complacency over the recommendations already in place. The Minister of Education said that remote learning remains a possibility for all schools in Sweden, with each district allowed to take their local situation into account before the start of the school year next week.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden lifted its recommendation against non-essential travel to Austria and Liechtenstein, but extended restrictions on non-exempted EU countries and the UK until August 26. The government also reintroduced restrictions on Morocco starting August 15. The ban on non-exempted third countries is set to expire on August 31, but may be extended depending on the epidemiological situation elsewhere. Sweden released its reopening guidelines for secondary schools, which are recommended but not mandatory. The guidelines include staggered start times, social distancing in class, enhanced cleaning measures, and distance learning if necessary.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Most new cases in Sweden are connected to younger people. The government has asked Swedes to remain vigilant to prevent further spread. Sweden reported no new deaths related to COVID-19 on August 7 for the first time since mid-March. Massive crowds were reported at several beaches in southern Sweden over the weekend--public bathing areas are exempt from the gathering limit of 50 people. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said that testing and contact tracing are crucial to Swedenís next phase of the pandemic. He also stressed that it is important not to relax the restrictions, even as the number of new cases have fallen over the past month. Tegnell highlighted that the number of tests performed has also fallen and it is possible that the virus is more widespread than the number of cases indicates.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden has lifted its recommendation against non-essential travel to four more countries: Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. The government also extended its recommendation against non-essential travel to non-exempted EU countries and the UK until August 12. Sweden will extend its recommendation to work from home until the end of 2020 to ease congestion on public transit in the fall. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said that Sweden may recommend wearing face-masks if the infection rate in the country were to rise again. Officials in the coastal region of V‰stra Gˆtaland have warned that tourist areas have been overcrowded in recent days, and pointed to COVID-19 fatigue and falling infection rates in the country as the reason why Swedes have been flouting social distancing recommendations.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Public Health Agency of Sweden is changing its test and trace strategy to make it easier to mandate that COVID-19 patients themselves be responsible for tracking their close contacts, rather than healthcare officials. Healthcare officials have cited the difficulty in performing contact tracing duties in addition to their work related to the pandemic. Similar procedures apply to other infectious diseases in Sweden. Swedish authorities do not expect to introduce a mandatory mask policy despite the EUís recommendation that they be worn on public transit. Support for PM Lofven and his governmentís approach to the COVID-19 pandemic has fallen sharply over the past few months, with the PMís approval rating falling from +7 to neutral, according to a recent poll.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden has lifted its recommendation against non-essential travel to Germany, Poland, and Andorra, but reintroduced the measure on travel to Switzerland. The update to restrictions came a day after Germany allowed Swedish travellers to enter the country without self-isolating. The Swedish government also extended its recommendation against travel to non-exempted EU countries until July 29, while the ban on travel to and from non-EU countries is scheduled to end on August 31. Exceptions to the nationwide ban on visits to hospitals and long-term care facilities have been outlined, allowing visitors if they have COVID-19 antibodies, or they are visiting someone receiving end-of-life care. Public health officials are warning that rural areas frequented by tourists in the summer could be the site of potential outbreaks. Authorities highlighted limited hospital capacity and a large proportion of elderly residents as particularly concerning for destinations that have had a limited number of infections thus far.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Swedenís healthcare watchdog has reported that some residents of long-term care homes did not receive appropriate healthcare in the midst of the pandemic. After strict restrictions on long-term care homes were issued by some municipalities, some homes reported that they were unable to let doctors in to assess individual residents. Nearly half of all Swedish deaths from COVID-19 occurred in long-term care homes. Starting on July 15, Sweden will update its travel advice every two weeks. Swedes are currently able to travel to 14 countries in the EU; advice against non-essential travel is still in place for all other European countries. With a few exceptions, all countries exempted from the advice do not have quarantine requirements in place for Swedish travellers.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Restaurants, bars, and cafes in Sweden must now guarantee that each group of patrons has at least one metre of distance between themselves and adjacent groups. Members of the same group from different households should also have at least an armís length between them. The new restriction comes as local councils have taken over enforcement of restrictions against overcrowding at eateries, empowering them to issue shutdown orders. Sweden will exempt all countries on the EUís safe third country list from its ban on entry by travellers from non-EU/EEA countries, which was recently extended to August 31. A law that granted the Swedish government emergency powers expired on June 30 without ever being used. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has fought back against the WHOís assessment of Sweden as a country that is at ëspecial riskí of COVID-19, saying that it was a ëtotal misinterpretationí of Swedish case numbers and testing figures. The WHOís European branch later acknowledged that Sweden had made progress, but said that the infection rate remained very high.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden has extended the countryís ban on travellers from outside the EU/EEA until July 7. Exceptions apply to EU citizens, Swedish residents, and those working in essential services. Amusement parks in Sweden will not be able to obtain an exemption from gathering limits (the current limit is 50) for the entire summer season, forcing virtually all operations to cease. Park operators were hoping to acquire the same status as zoos, which are not covered under the Ordinance Actís guidelines on gathering limits. Sweden will appoint an independent commission to investigate the countryís response to the pandemic, which plans to complete its review before the next election in 2022. Swedes appear to be losing confidence in the governmentís ability to deal with COVID-19: an Ipsos poll showed for the first time that less than a majority of respondents have ëstrong confidenceí in the governmentís response to the pandemic.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In one of the few legal restrictions that the government imposed, Sweden has extended its ban on visits to long-term care homes from June 30 until August 31 as the infection rate in the country remains high. In line with a recommendation from the European Commission, Sweden extended its ban on travel from non-EU/EEA countries until June 30, with some exemptions for essential workers. Furthermore, Sweden will scrap its recommendations against non-essential travel to 10 European countries from June 30. Notably, the list only includes countries that do not have any travel restrictions on Swedish citizens, and therefore does not include Norway, Denmark or Finland. The recommendation against travel to all other EU/EEA countries will be in place until July 15, and to all non-EU/EEA countries until August 31. While not a legally enforceable ban, the recommendation means that non-essential travel will not be covered by travel insurance.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Sweden will lift all of its recommendations on limiting domestic travel on June 13. The government had previously recommended that asymptomatic people limit their travel to a one-to-two hour car ride away from their home. While those from outside the EU/EEA are still not allowed to enter Sweden, several clarifications have been made about exemptions to the rule. Immediate family members (spouse, partner or child) of Swedish citizens and residents will now be allowed to enter the country. The exemption applies even if the person does not have an ìestablished homeî in Sweden, as was previously the case. Extended family members cannot visit family in Sweden if they are not an EU/EEA citizen, though exceptions can be made in individual cases. Foreign seasonal workers in agriculture, forestry and horticulture industries will also be permitted to enter the country from June 8. Swedish police have said that they will be stricter in granting permits for demonstrations after a number of anti-racism protests around the country violated the gathering limit of 50 people.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In a radio interview, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has admitted that Sweden should have committed itself to a more restrictive lockdown strategy than what was undertaken. Tegnell later backtracked his remarks in the interview, saying that he stands by Swedenís strategy as a whole but that there is room for improvement. These statements come after Tegnell has been defiant against criticism of the countryís strategy, while insisting that Swedenís approach was more sustainable than the harsh lockdowns undertaken elsewhere. PM Lofven bowed to opposition party pressure to appoint an independent commission to investigate the countryís COVID-19 response before the summer begins, after previously expressing his desire to wait until the pandemic is over. Nearly 8000 people gathered at an anti-racism protest in Stockholm on June 3, which was eventually broken up by police due to the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. Organizers were initially given permission for the protest to go ahead, but the crowd size swelled rapidly. The government issued a statement that said it gave permission for the protest because it is the organizerís responsibility to ensure their event meets social distancing guidelines, but it became clear that they lost control of the crowd and police were needed to maintain the 50-person limit. The government has also announced changes to its testing strategy, with any person with symptoms able to get tested (rather than a priority system) and the resumption of contact tracing for all those who test positive. Health Minister Lena Hallengren did not specify when this policy would be implemented, and said that it would be up to each region how they opt to test their population.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Officials in the SkÂne region have outlined their plan to increase the amount of testing in the region by offering tests to those working in non-healthcare essential services, and to those who require medical treatment of any kind, even if they do not need to go to the hospital. The Minister of Health Lena Hallengren is facing criticism after nearly 5000 fewer people were tested last week than the week before, and the country is still significantly below its testing capacity of 100,000. Hallengren has said that it was naive to place that high of a testing goal, and she acknowledged the logistical challenges that have made it so difficult to reach. In a separate interview, Hallengren said that she believes that Swedes have largely been following the governmentís recommendations, but acknowledged the high number of infections in long-term care homes. Opposition parties have scheduled debates in Parliament over the governmentís handling of the situation in long-term care homes, after previously supporting the governmentís strategy.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite its distinct approach to lockdown measures, business leaders in Sweden have said that the voluntary measures will not save them from the economic collapse felt in other countries. Sweden has extended its entry ban to those from outside Europe to June 15th, with exceptions for healthcare workers, supply chain reasons or urgent family matters. The ban does not apply to those seeking asylum, or foreign seasonal workers in essential businesses. The Swedish government has said it is in dialogue with Denmark to open their mutual border after expressing disapproval at Danish intentions to open its border to every other Nordic country. Other Nordic countries have also expressed their reservations at including Sweden in a potential Nordic travel bubble due to the much higher rate of infection among Swedes. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has said that domestic travel restrictions will likely be loosened at some point this summer, though he did not specify when. Sweden will expand testing to those experiencing only mild symptoms, as well as those working in critical services, though a doctorís approval is still needed to acquire a test.</p>
