      South Korea has been seeing a relatively stable level of new infections, fluctuating slightly around 40 per day. Sporadic outbreaks continue to occur at various venues while concentrating in the Seoul Metropolitan Region. Authorities urge renewed vigilance, especially among the elderly. Facilities deemed risky across the nation have begun adopting QR code entry logs, and they have until June 30 to complete the set-up. The national mask rationing scheme, originally set to end this month, has been extended to mid-July, with a higher purchase limit beginning June 18. Clinical trials for the anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, have been halted. The government confirmed a plan on June 15 to elevate the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) to an independent administrative body that can handle their own budget and personnel. The strengthened control measures for the Seoul Region, such as gathering bans on high-risk facilities and suspensions of public facility operation, have been extended until conditions improve. Around 8,000 facilities have been shut down accordingly and citizens are urged to adhere to health precautions and refrain from nonessential gatherings and outings. Businesses and services outside Seoul are able to operate as normal. Schools have reopened to all students while many students in lower grades are alternating between in-person and online classes. South Korea and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to grant quarantine exemptions for travel for essential purposes such as business and academics.

      South Korea is still grappling with a resurgence of COVID-19 where they are seeing new transmissions occurring through various venues. On June 10, QR code-based entry logs were implemented in entertainment facilities and some auditoriums across the country. Private educational institutes, religious facilities, hospitals and other venues are also encouraged to adopt this contact tracing measure. Starting June 8, the virus test has been free for all Seoul residents, including those without respiratory symptoms, but with some testing restrictions. Remdesivir has been granted emergency approval for treating critical COVID-19 patients. South Korea’s first clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine will begin this month, and target a total of 160 adults in two stages. Although some restrictive measures like gathering bans were reintroduced in the Seoul Metropolitan Region, most businesses and services continue to operate across the country while following infection prevention requirements. Schools have reopened to all students while many students in lower grades are alternating between in-person classes and online teaching.

      South Korea has been wrestling with a resurgence of cases since the beginning of May with major outbreaks in nightclubs and a logistics center. The government is planning to use test quick response (QR) code-based entry logs across a variety of facilities including nightclubs, eateries, cinemas and churches starting this week, before expanding it to include high-risk facilities across the country so they can better track the virus. Importing remdesivir is being pursued as an emergency treatment for critically ill patients. Enhanced epidemic control measures were implemented on May 28 for the Seoul Metropolitan Region and will remain until June 14. Facilities, such as bars, singing rooms and PC cafes are recommended to close and might be subject to a gathering ban. Companies have been recommended to incorporate telecommuting and flexible work schedules. Residents are urged to refrain from social gathering or visiting places frequented by many people. No further restrictive measures have been reintroduced nationwide and most businesses continue to operate following everyday infection prevention practices. More students returned to in-person classes on June 3 despite widespread concerns over infections in schools, leaving only students in the first grade of middle school and higher grades of elementary school studying virtually. Businesses frequented by teenagers are strongly advised to remain closed until June 14.

      South Korea has experienced a major spike in COVID-19 infections over the past weeks, with more than 250 new cases related to nightclubs confirmed as of May 27. Widespread testing is being conducted among those who are known to have recently visited the venues connected to this resurgence. New testing kits with the potential to produce the results within 1 hour are undergoing review before their widespread use is approved. Kindergarten students, primary school students in grades 1-2, and middle school students in grades 9 and 11 resumed in-person classes on May 27 with strict preventative measures rules and flexible scheduling in place. Some schools have chosen to postpone their reopening. All other students are expected to resume in-person classes at the beginning of June. Professional sporting events have been permitted to resume without fans. Despite the warm weather creating difficulties with respect to wearing masks, it remains mandatory for people boarding public transport and flights. In order to cope with imported cases, South Korea is asking that long-term stayers acquire re-entry permits and physiological assessments arriving in the country.

      Following a series of outbreaks associated with nightclubs and hospitals, South Korea has been carrying out a robust epidemiological investigation into these outbreaks, and implementing control measures to suppress a possible resurgence. People are being urged to stay vigilant and avoid visiting indoor places where close physical contact is likely. To strengthen monitoring, additional diagnostic tests will be provided to nursing homes and mental hospitals. High school seniors returned to in-person classes on May 18, while all other students will resume classes gradually according to regional and school conditions. Fever tests will be conducted at least twice a day - once before entering a classroom, and again at midday - and suspicious symptoms will be checked frequently. Both students and teachers are required to wear masks at all times. A school will be shut and teaching will be switched to the online system if a confirmed case is identified. Restrictive measures on non-essential activities have mostly been lifted. “Distancing in Daily Life” remains the standard: two arms’ distancing, personal hygiene, frequent ventilation and disinfection, social connection, and staying home if feeling unwell.
