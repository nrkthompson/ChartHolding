  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in South Korea has stayed under 200 for more than two weeks, but a significant proportion of infections has been untraceable since mid-August. Due to an upcoming major holiday, the government and local offices are encouraging people to spend the holiday with only close family members and refrain from long-distance travel. The government has entered into an arrangement to secure COVID-19 vaccines for 30 million people, or roughly 60% of the total population. A two-track approach will be adopted, with some of the doses sourced through the COVAX Facility, a global vaccine initiative, and others through private companies. The export of protective face masks was permitted starting on September 14, subject to certain quotas. After a local person was confirmed to have both the flu and COVID-19, South Korea is now directly facing the intersection of the two epidemics. The government decided on September 13 to ease many restrictions on the Seoul Metropolitan Region for two weeks -- although the region has not met the designated benchmarks -- out of economic considerations. Dining in is once again permitted at coffee chains and other food outlets after 9 pm. All visitors are still required to provide contact details at restaurants. “High-risk” businesses such as gyms, private tutoring services, and computer game rooms can resume operations under limited conditions. The ban on in-person church activities continues. Despite the relaxation, local officials in Seoul have decided to extend a ban on rallies of 10 or more people until October 11. Starting September 21, schools in Seoul and its surrounding regions have resumed in-person classes, subject to a two-thirds capacity cap on high schools and a one-third cap for all other schools. Schools in the rest of the country enjoy the discretion to set their own limits based on the local situation.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The level of daily new infections has dropped from over 300 to below 200 in South Korea over the past two weeks, but authorities remain cautious. As hospital beds filled up in Seoul, public health authorities have been expediting bed turnover by recommending that patients with mild symptoms recover at home. South Korea plans to mass-produce an antibody-based therapy for COVID-19 later this month, with its Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trial plans under review. To prevent simultaneous spread of COVID-19 and influenza, free flu shots will be offered to children, the elderly, and pregnant women through November. Children under 9 years old can receive their flu shot from September 8. After weeks of clashes with the government, striking interns and resident doctors are now set to return to work while medical students continue boycotting the licensing examination. The government has promised to reconsider the contested medical reform policies but shows no intention of addressing student demands. Amid political and social controversy over the right to protest, Seoul has banned most of rallies planned for National Foundation Day on October 3. The nationwide Level 2 social distancing scheme will be in place until September 20, while the Seoul Metropolitan Region will be at the so-called Level 2.5 through September 13. Under Level 2.5 social distancing, only takeout and delivery services are available between 9 pm and 5 am at restaurants, bakeries and bars. Private cram schools and indoor sports facilities were shut down. One-third of all employees working in the government, state-run agencies and public institutions are required to work from home. Dining-in is completely banned at franchise coffee chains, bakeries and ice-cream shops starting September 14. All schools in the Seoul Metropolitan Region will continue offering remote classes, with the exception of classes for high school seniors, until September 20.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Having experienced a relatively limited level of daily new infections for three months, South Korea saw a dramatic spike--which is still on the rise. An August 15 rally has emerged as a center of concern. Health authorities are now facing an overwhelming workload to trace and test tens of thousands of people, the vast majority of whom are not identified. Nearly 70% were in their 60s or over. On August 21, police raided a church associated with the rally following a failed attempt to secure a full list of its members. The president has called for measures including criminal charges for anyone trying to impede epidemiological investigation. Joining other provinces and cities, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has made mask wearing in public mandatory starting at midnight on August 24. Heightened social distancing rules have been expanded from Seoul and its surrounding areas to the whole country. Any indoor gatherings of 50 people or more and outdoor gatherings of 100 or more are banned.  Seoul separately bans street rallies of 10 or more. Public facilities and high-risk facilities such as nightclubs, karaoke bars, buffets, gyms and private cram schools are shut down. In-person church services are now prohibited. All beaches around the country are closed. Starting August 26, kindergartens, elementary schools and middle schools in Seoul and the surrounding province will have to reduce student attendance to one-third of the total. High schools will lower attendance to two-thirds. The government is going to run 130 learning support centers throughout the country to support the academic efforts of students found to be behind others.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea has experienced a dramatic increase in new, locally acquired cases--mainly due to outbreaks at churches in the Greater Seoul area. Cases linked to community transmission are increasingly becoming a concern. The president has warned of stern responses to unlawful rallies by some church members that have violated the state ban. Doctors launched strikes across the country in protest of the government's medical reform plan to recruit more doctors, the majority of whom will be deployed in rural areas. The striking doctors are worried that the additional healthcare workforce will be abused by the industry to exploit the existing workers. The government has tightened social distancing in Seoul and its neighboring areas to Level 2 (in the three-tier system) for two weeks starting from August 16. All indoor gatherings of 50 or more people and outdoor gatherings of 100 or more will be banned. Public facilities are shut down and high-risk facilities, such as bars, should suspend their business. Professional sports will revert to having no spectators. As more schools are considering larger in-person instruction in the upcoming semester, the government said the decision lies with each autonomous office as to what type of instruction it will institute. But a cap on student numbers is strongly recommended at two-thirds of full attendance for schools with more than 1,000 students and classrooms with more than 30 students.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea continues to report a limited level of daily new infections. Health authorities are now concerned about fluctuations in locally acquired new cases. New clusters of infections linked to churches remain one of the top concerns--even when targeted restrictions have been lifted. Infection prevention functions are being incorporated into some of the smart bus shelters in Seoul, equipping them with ultraviolet light air sterilizers and thermal imaging cameras that could check people’s body temperature. South Koreas have been cautioned that, even after a vaccine is developed, there will be no immediate change to infection prevention rules: people will still have to wear masks and maintain social distancing. An antibody treatment for COVID-19 has been authorized by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety on July 17 and is now in a phase 1 clinical trial. Four out of 106 patients in South Korea have shown side effects after being administered remdesivir. Restrictions on arrivals from Hubei province in China will be lifted on August 10.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea has managed to take control of the second wave as it continues to record a low level of local transmissions. Health officials said on July 29 that more patrols and closed-circuit television cameras would be installed around quarantine sites following a series of recent escapes from the facilities. The punishment will also be toughened for foreign residents who report false self-isolation addresses when they re-enter the country after overseas trips. Plans are underway to inspect and verify if residences registered by inbound foreigners are fit for self-isolation. If not, people will be put in a dedicated quarantine facility. The government is set to address the economic impact of the pandemic as well. The creation of some 93,000 jobs is being planned, involving coronavirus duties such as disinfecting affected areas and detecting safety protocol violations. Medical institutions and businesses will be compensated for part of their losses caused by the pandemic. Cities and provinces that agree to accommodate passengers who require a two-week quarantine will be paid government incentives. South Korea said on August 4 that it will release data on restaurants that follow sanitary guidelines in order to minimize the spread of the virus and to induce people to dine out more--without being excessively concerned about safety. Citing difficulties in maintaining infection prevention rules, the Seoul government announced its decision not to operate all seven riverside pools and water parks this summer. Starting August 3, seafarers on all vessels departing from Russia will be required to submit a certificate of a negative test; some infections have been traced to Russian ships.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea has been reporting a low level of locally acquired cases in the past few days. Health officials have suggested that they may start charging passengers arriving with COVID-19 for medical expenses. August 17 has been designated a temporary holiday, creating a one-off long weekend to help relieve public fatigue over the pandemic. As the second wave in the country seems to subside, the reopening of the economy is getting back on track. Museums, art galleries, libraries and performing arts halls in the Seoul Metropolitan Region reopened on July 22 after being closed for two months. These facilities will limit their capacity and use reservation and visitor registration systems. Each facility was able to specify its own guidelines. Sporting events are still prohibited from having spectators. The ban on small church gatherings other than regular services was lifted on July 24, as new cases linked to such gatherings subsided. Social welfare facilities also resumed operations starting on July 20. A group of Korean businesspeople were allowed to enter Vietnam and China via chartered flights on July 22, although a 14-day quarantine upon arrival was still required.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Most new cases in South Korea are related to overseas travel. With the increasing number of foreign arrivals, more public facilities for self-quarantine have been opened. The government said on July 17 that it would send additional chartered flights to Iraq to bring back the workers on a construction site, even though confirmed cases among the workers accounted for a large portion of the overall imported cases. The government is considering requesting that all U.S. military personnel go through testing before departing for bases in South Korea. The Korea Tourism Organization has selected 100 non-contact summer tourist spots to encourage domestic travel, based on criteria such as suitability for solo or family trips, outdoor travel or social distancing. An alert system has been adopted for 50 major beaches that would ban the entry of additional visitors in crowded areas. Travellers from high-risk countries will be required to submit proof of a negative PCR test before entry and may face issues in acquiring an entry visa. Regular flights linking high-risk countries and South Korea will fly with less than 60% seat capacity. Starting on July 24, the visa-free entry and screening process for foreign sailing crews entering South Korea will be temporarily suspended.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea continued recording dozens of new infections per day during the past week. Transmission is no longer concentrated in the Seoul Metropolitan Region but is occurring sporadically across the country. The mask rationing system was terminated on July 12 as the supply stabilized. The country is maintaining restrictions on exports of masks while raising the quotas of outbound shipments. 48.9 billion KRW (approximately $41 million USD) has been allocated in the government’s 3rd Supplementary Budget to expand the influenza vaccination program to prepare for a possible future influenza outbreak coinciding with the COVID-19 outbreak. Health authorities show no intention to raise the nationwide distancing level and are leaving the rules at the discretion to local governments--despite growing calls to make the measures stricter. A growing number of seaside villages are now closing their beaches due to fear of COVID-19 transmission. Due to recent outbreaks related to religious activities, it became mandatory for all churches to stop hosting activities outside of regular services and to ensure mask wearing at all times, effective July 10. Starting on July 13, foreigners arriving from high-risk countries will be required to submit a certificate of a negative test result before entering South Korea. Direct flights from high-risk countries have also been ordered to limit the number of passengers to 60% capacity.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea’s daily new infections have stayed above 60 for the past few days and the number of new cases outside the Seoul Metropolitan Region continues to grow. 522 schools, or 2.5% of all schools nationwide (except for postsecondary institutions), have been closed as of July 2 due to outbreaks. The ninth edition of the COVID-19 response guidelines went into effect on June 25, adding the symptom-based isolation release criteria. Asymptomatic patients will be released from quarantine if they show no symptoms for 10 days after having tested positive. A mandatory entry log system using QR codes was formally launched on July 1 at some 80,000 high-risk venues such as entertainment facilities. Owing to a recent outbreak related to a Russian ship, entry screening at sea ports will be tightened starting July 1 and temporary landing will be minimized. To ensure a clinical evidence-based response, the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention has decided to share the anonymized clinical epidemiological information of about 5,500 cases with specific institutions. The restrictions reintroduced in the Seoul Region, such as restricted gatherings at high-risk venues and closing public facilities, have been extended until the situation improves. In the other areas, people have returned to their everyday life following basic infection prevention measures. Spectators were allowed to attend sports events last week if observing physical distancing and hygiene rules, with a 30% capacity limit. Safe domestic tourism is being promoted, which includes elements like non-contact tourist attractions. South Korea announced on June 28 that it would adopt a three-level social distancing scheme based on the level of daily new cases. A move from Level 1 (the current level) to Level 2 would be triggered if daily infections exceed 50 for 14 straight days, and indoor gatherings of 50 or more and outdoor gatherings of over 100 would then be prohibited.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea has seemingly stabilized its level of new infections, with about 40 new cases per day. On June 23, the president pressed the National Assembly to approve the delayed third COVID-19 financial stimulus package worth $29 billion. Guidelines were issued on June 16 to expedite vaccines’ early entry into clinical trials and to strengthen clinical trial capacity. To improve working conditions in hot weather for medical staff, the government has prepared a plan to reduce regular working time, supply additional workforce and distribute extra equipment. As hospitals experience bed shortages in the worst hit areas, experts are suggesting prioritizing urgent cases rather than admitting all COVID-19 patients. Adults fully recovered from COVID-19 are encouraged to participate in developing plasma therapy. Free pneumococcal vaccinations for the elderly have been expanded from public health centers to private institutions starting June 22 to offer better protection. People are urged to stay vigilant particularly during the hot summer. Normal life is moving on across the country except for the Seoul metropolitan region. With more than 200 new community infections related to door-to-door sales, direct-sale promotion has been designated as high risk and staff have to keep a strict log of all customers and comply with infection prevention rules. A measure to reduce classroom crowding has been extended until mid-July, requiring high schools to cap the number of students at two thirds of the total student body and capping the lower grades at one third. South Korea decided on June 21 to stop issuing new visas to Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, except for diplomatic and urgent business purposes, due to a spike of imported cases from the two countries. Also, non-regular flights linking Bangladesh and Pakistan to South Korea were suspended.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea has been seeing a relatively stable level of new infections, fluctuating slightly around 40 per day. Sporadic outbreaks continue to occur at various venues while concentrating in the Seoul Metropolitan Region. Authorities urge renewed vigilance, especially among the elderly. Facilities deemed risky across the nation have begun adopting QR code entry logs, and they have until June 30 to complete the set-up. The national mask rationing scheme, originally set to end this month, has been extended to mid-July, with a higher purchase limit beginning June 18. Clinical trials for the anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, have been halted. The government confirmed a plan on June 15 to elevate the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) to an independent administrative body that can handle their own budget and personnel. The strengthened control measures for the Seoul Region, such as gathering bans on high-risk facilities and suspensions of public facility operation, have been extended until conditions improve. Around 8,000 facilities have been shut down accordingly and citizens are urged to adhere to health precautions and refrain from nonessential gatherings and outings. Businesses and services outside Seoul are able to operate as normal. Schools have reopened to all students while many students in lower grades are alternating between in-person and online classes. South Korea and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to grant quarantine exemptions for travel for essential purposes such as business and academics.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea is still grappling with a resurgence of COVID-19 where they are seeing new transmissions occurring through various venues. On June 10, QR code-based entry logs were implemented in entertainment facilities and some auditoriums across the country. Private educational institutes, religious facilities, hospitals and other venues are also encouraged to adopt this contact tracing measure. Starting June 8, the virus test has been free for all Seoul residents, including those without respiratory symptoms, but with some testing restrictions. Remdesivir has been granted emergency approval for treating critical COVID-19 patients. South Korea’s first clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine will begin this month, and target a total of 160 adults in two stages. Although some restrictive measures like gathering bans were reintroduced in the Seoul Metropolitan Region, most businesses and services continue to operate across the country while following infection prevention requirements. Schools have reopened to all students while many students in lower grades are alternating between in-person classes and online teaching.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea has been wrestling with a resurgence of cases since the beginning of May with major outbreaks in nightclubs and a logistics center. The government is planning to use test quick response (QR) code-based entry logs across a variety of facilities including nightclubs, eateries, cinemas and churches starting this week, before expanding it to include high-risk facilities across the country so they can better track the virus. Importing remdesivir is being pursued as an emergency treatment for critically ill patients. Enhanced epidemic control measures were implemented on May 28 for the Seoul Metropolitan Region and will remain until June 14. Facilities, such as bars, singing rooms and PC cafes are recommended to close and might be subject to a gathering ban. Companies have been recommended to incorporate telecommuting and flexible work schedules. Residents are urged to refrain from social gathering or visiting places frequented by many people. No further restrictive measures have been reintroduced nationwide and most businesses continue to operate following everyday infection prevention practices. More students returned to in-person classes on June 3 despite widespread concerns over infections in schools, leaving only students in the first grade of middle school and higher grades of elementary school studying virtually. Businesses frequented by teenagers are strongly advised to remain closed until June 14.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">South Korea has experienced a major spike in COVID-19 infections over the past weeks, with more than 250 new cases related to nightclubs confirmed as of May 27. Widespread testing is being conducted among those who are known to have recently visited the venues connected to this resurgence. New testing kits with the potential to produce the results within 1 hour are undergoing review before their widespread use is approved. Kindergarten students, primary school students in grades 1-2, and middle school students in grades 9 and 11 resumed in-person classes on May 27 with strict preventative measures rules and flexible scheduling in place. Some schools have chosen to postpone their reopening. All other students are expected to resume in-person classes at the beginning of June. Professional sporting events have been permitted to resume without fans. Despite the warm weather creating difficulties with respect to wearing masks, it remains mandatory for people boarding public transport and flights. In order to cope with imported cases, South Korea is asking that long-term stayers acquire re-entry permits and physiological assessments arriving in the country.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a series of outbreaks associated with nightclubs and hospitals, South Korea has been carrying out a robust epidemiological investigation into these outbreaks, and implementing control measures to suppress a possible resurgence. People are being urged to stay vigilant and avoid visiting indoor places where close physical contact is likely. To strengthen monitoring, additional diagnostic tests will be provided to nursing homes and mental hospitals. High school seniors returned to in-person classes on May 18, while all other students will resume classes gradually according to regional and school conditions. Fever tests will be conducted at least twice a day - once before entering a classroom, and again at midday - and suspicious symptoms will be checked frequently. Both students and teachers are required to wear masks at all times. A school will be shut and teaching will be switched to the online system if a confirmed case is identified. Restrictive measures on non-essential activities have mostly been lifted. “Distancing in Daily Life” remains the standard: two arms’ distancing, personal hygiene, frequent ventilation and disinfection, social connection, and staying home if feeling unwell.</p>
