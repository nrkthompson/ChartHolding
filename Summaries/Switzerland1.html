      Switzerland’s defence department has been tasked with securing enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to treat its population. The country’s strategy continues to emphasize reducing new infection rates, testing symptomatic people, and contact tracing. Switzerland has remained cautious about the value of antibody testing, and has not yet bought any tests. On May 15Switzerland became the first country in Europe to end hospitality related restrictions. Despite being reopened, new measures have been implemented, which include menus being made available on an iPad that can be wiped clean, hand disinfectant stations, and distancing measures between tables. On May 20th, the Federal Council declared it would allow religious services to resume on May 28. While the Federal Office of Public Health has released a protection framework, religious communities are being given a week to come up with their own protection plans. Beginning June 15th, Germany, France, and Austria will open their borders with Switzerland provided that infections remain under control.
