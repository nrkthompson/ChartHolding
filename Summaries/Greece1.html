      Greece entered the third phase of their reopening plan on May 18, reopening malls, some schools, archeological sites, and beaches. Primary schools and kindergartens remain closed, but middle schools and high schools will operate by dividing classes into two groups and alternating the groups on different days. Other measures include having a maximum of 15 students per classroom, optional face masks, and the cleaning and disinfection of school facilities twice a day. Online learning will be provided for students who are unable to attend classes and for the days students are not in school. Greece’s tourism sector is set to begin reopening by June 15, starting with the reopening of seasonal hotels. Greece reopened 500 public beaches under strict physical distancing measures that include guidelines for the number of beachgoers and distances between beach umbrellas and sunbeds. A mandatory 14 day quarantine for incoming visitors and returning residents has been extended until the end of May. Free travel between regions on the mainland and to the island of Crete will resume, and sea travel will be allowed with boats filled to 50% capacity. While airports are reopening to international traffic later this month, it is unclear when direct flights to the main tourist islands will resume. The government has announced their plan to offer sample tests to incoming tourists but, not whether these will be available to all.
