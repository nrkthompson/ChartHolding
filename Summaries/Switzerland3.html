      June 1 signified the return to some political normalcy with federal initiatives and referendum requests resuming. Collecting signatures in public spaces will also now be permitted, given that protective measures are enforced. Effective June 6, several restrictions will be eased across the country. Public gatherings of 30 people and events of no more than 300 people will be permitted. Zoos, gardens, nightclubs, pools, campgrounds, theatres and cinemas will reopen. Swiss politicians decided that sex work can resume, but are facing criticism due to the continued ban on sports and activities that involve close physical contact. The Swiss ruling contrasts policy decisions in the Netherlands to keep the sex service sector closed until September. In the coming weeks, Swiss borders will reopen with Germany, Austria and France, but will maintain closed borders with Italy.
