      Mexico City expects their peak between the end of May and beginning of June. Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab therapies are authorized by relevant government agencies and are being tested in hospitals. Mexico is looking to approve additional therapies including using convalescent plasma. 2000 ventilators arrived from the US and an 11th flight arrived from China with ventilators, COVID-19 tests, gloves, and material to produce N95 masks. Although authorized in Mexicoâ€™s reopening plan, 26 out of approximately 203 municipalities in Oaxaca that reported no COVID-19 cases decided not to reopen on May 18th. As of May 18th, construction, mining, and automaking services could resume and approximately 28 textile and automotive companies received approval from the Secretary of Health to reopen with 20-30% of their workforce. The government requests people stay home until May 30th and insists reopening will be gradual. In preview of a second wave of COVID-19 in October, the government may enforce additional measures regionally to avoid the negative impact of national restrictions. The government may also keep the changes that they made to public hospitals that increased their patient capacity and will continue buying supplies and PPE from China to stay equipped. Medical staff continue protesting the quality and quantity of available PPE and other supplies. Some governors are not pleased with how federalism worked during the pandemic and argue that it should be reviewed.
