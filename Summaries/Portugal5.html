      On June 15, The Metropolitan area of Lisbon entered phase three of deconfinement, a week after the rest of the country entered the third phase, following a reduction in the outbreak of COVID-19 cases. The same rules now apply in Lisbon as the rest of the country which includes the reopening of  large shopping centres, commercial establishments of over 400 square meters, leisure centres and water parks, along with an increase in gathering limit of 10 to 20 people. Even though Spain has announced the reopening of its borders to countries in the EU’s Schengen area effective June 21, free movement to Portugal is only allowed starting July 1. Portugal’s Covid-tracking app, ‘stay away’ is due to be launched by the end of June. Through bluetooth technology, it aims to provide ‘rapid alert’ to users who have been in contact with someone who has since been diagnosed with COVID-19. The science and technology minister has guaranteed that all data collected by the app will be anonymous, with the use of it voluntary. The minister expects a number of public and private institutions to recommend the use of the app – suggesting that while it will not be mandatory, people may end up being persuaded to download the software to satisfy requests in their day-to-day routines.
