      On May 30, the Polish government proceeded to the fourth phase of its plan for lifting restrictions related to COVID-19, reopening cinemas, theatres, gyms, massage parlours and salons. Polish residents are no longer required to use a mask in outdoor spaces, provided that they can maintain at least 2 metres of distance between each other. Masks will still be required in many confined spaces and indoor venues, such as shops, churches, buses and streetcars. Capacity limits on the number of people allowed in various establishments at once have been lifted, including catering establishments, churches, and government service centers, all of which are being allowed to operate at full capacity, provided that they are able to maintain a safe distance between patrons. Limits on mass gatherings increased, with weddings, outdoor concerts, and other public gatherings now being limited to 150 guests. Hotel restaurants and bars are allowed to serve guests, and hotels will be allowed to fully reopen all of their facilities, including gyms and swimming pools by June 6. On June 1, the Slovak government proceeded to the fifth stage of its plan for easing restrictions related to COVID-19. While kindergartens and daycares were already permitted to reopen, primary schools are now also allowed to resume teaching for grades one to five. On June 3, secondary schools were allowed to reopen for final examinations. All retail and catering establishments have been allowed to reopen fully, provided that they are able to maintain a safe distance between patrons and adhere to a strict sanitary regime. All shopping centres, theatres, cinemas, spas, swimming pools and gyms are allowed to reopen according to similar standards. General guidelines on hygiene and physical distancing, such as the obligatory use of facemasks in all public places, continue to apply to most residents. On May 24, the Slovak government announced the release of its contact tracing app, eKaranténa, available on all Android smartphones. Effective immediately, everyone arriving at Slovakia’s border looking to enter or travel throughout the country is required to download and register for the application. iPhone users will be able to download the application after Apple’s approval.
