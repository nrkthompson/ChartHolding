      On May 30, the Polish government proceeded to the fourth phase of its plan for lifting restrictions related to COVID-19, reopening cinemas, theatres, gyms, massage parlours and salons. Polish residents are no longer required to use a mask in outdoor spaces, provided that they can maintain at least 2 metres of distance between each other. Masks will still be required in many confined spaces and indoor venues, such as shops, churches, buses and streetcars. Capacity limits on the number of people allowed in various establishments at once have been lifted, including catering establishments, churches, and government service centers, all of which are being allowed to operate at full capacity, provided that they are able to maintain a safe distance between patrons. Limits on mass gatherings increased, with weddings, outdoor concerts, and other public gatherings now being limited to 150 guests. Hotel restaurants and bars are allowed to serve guests, and hotels will be allowed to fully reopen all of their facilities, including gyms and swimming pools by June 6.
