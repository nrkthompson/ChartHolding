      The WHO praised Mexico’s response to the pandemic for their economic support plan and their decision to maintain Mexico’s epidemiological response plan to COVID-19 until the situation improves. Mexico received masks and ventilators from China on May 22 and 23. Mexico will not fully reopen until a vaccine is circulated, but as companies begin reopening some companies committed to doing employee testing. The Mexico-US border will remain closed to non-essential travel until June 22. As of May 18, construction, mining and automaking reopened. On June 1, the Mexican reopening plan will incorporate a traffic light system to reopen different sectors of society in different regions. Mexico City remains closed until minimum June 15 with exceptions for essential services. Depending on the number of  hospitalizations, the capital will reopen hotels and cinemas in July, schools and offices in August followed by bars and gyms in September. At a press conference on May 29th, the government explained that most, but not all, of Mexico remained locked down, which would gradually ease and allow more non-essential services to reopen as of June 1st based on risk and expected social value. Companies must register with the government virtually prior to reopening. Schools will continue virtual learning with free textbooks and various educational telecommunications programs. To reopen schools, regions must achieve green status, or the final stage of reopening, but the government anticipates that remedial courses will reopen in person in August and schools in September. The Maya Train project in the Chiapas is reopening. Cancun and Mexico will be one of the first locations in the Americas to receive approval through the Global Safety Stamp by the World Travel and Tourism Council.
