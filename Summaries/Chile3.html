      Chile has over 100,000 cases and had a new peak of daily deaths from COVID-19 on June 2 with 75. Santiago and 38 towns in the area continue to be under lockdown. Chile received 65 more ventilators on May 29. To meet a government goal of increased hospital patient capacity, hospitals are converting other departments to accommodate more beds and more ventilators. The Ministry of Health is also trying to increase their capacities in testing, patient treatment and isolation with more sanitary residences. Through public-private collaborations, more PPE will be delivered to nursing homes. Major cities in the country remain under lockdown. As of Friday May 29, Chile reported their highest number of deaths in one day at 49 deaths, the government expects the rising trend to continue without proper distancing and lockdown measures being respected.  The government released a National Tourism Plan to offer support and guidance for protocols in restimulating the tourism sector.
