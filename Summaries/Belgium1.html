      Phase 2 of Belgium’s deconfinement strategy came into effect on May 18th, reopening schools, cultural sites, and amusement parks. Nursery schools are still closed but, primary and secondary lessons resumed with groups of 10 students per classroom. Measures are being enforced which include a minimum of 4 square metres per pupil and temperature checks for students and staff. Despite the reopening of zoos and parks, the cafeterias, restaurants, and playgrounds located on these grounds must stay closed. People cannot sit down, picnic, or sunbathe in the recently reopened parks. Across the country, teleworking remains the norm despite some businesses reopening. Belgium plans to reopen its borders to tourists on June 15th, conditional on the health risks in and around the country, and international agreements surrounding contact tracing. Frontline health workers expressed their disappointment in the Belgian government’s handling of the crisis after staff formed a reception committee for the Prime Minister and turned their backs on her car upon arrival at a hospital in Brussels. Workers are unhappy with the government's attempts to recruit unqualified staff to provide support to nursing personnel rather than pay for trained professionals, in addition to budget cuts, low salaries, and staffing shortages.
