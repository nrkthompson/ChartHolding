  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Case and fatality rates have been declining in Chile over the past two months. On August 11, it was reported that in 24 hours, 39 people had died from COVID-19. The Airbus Foundation, the Chilean Red Cross, Servicios Aereos Kipreos and Servicios Aereos SumaAir have transported over 600kg of medical supplies and PPE to Chile. Students in the San Fernando commune will not return to in-person classes this year for their safety. On August 17, Chile lifted its quarantine on Santiago--one of the longest quarantines in the world--and moved the city into the transitional phase, or phase two of reopening. The government is working to verify that companies in the Mayor of Providencia region adhere to COVID-19 health measures. Chile’s government will establish a forum for people to anonymously report companies that do not comply with COVID-19 health measures.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 6, Chile’s minister of health reported a decrease in COVID-19 cases nationally. He said that cases had decreased drastically in 11 regions over the last seven days, and in eight regions over the last two weeks. However, Punta Arenas regressed from phase three of reopening to phase two, following a 200% increase in new cases over the past week. The government anticipates that their Paso-a-Paso reopening plan will remain in effect until the end of November. The Chilean government is working on gradually reopening national parks with restrictions.  These include: limiting groups, short safety presentations, encouraging credit card payment, and encouraging visitors to sanitize personal items before and after visiting.  The Alerce Costero National Park in the Los Rios region reopened on August 5. 62 other national protected areas are expected to reopen as municipalities enter phases two to five of reopening. The government published a document with recommendations for employers and employees to return to work safely. The document recommends: staying informed; consulting labour unions and creating health and safety committees with experts; increasing awareness and training; adapting the physical workspace; mental health support; traceability; and continuously evaluating and updating their plans. A sanitary residence has also been created for pregnant and lactating women who test COVID-19 positive. The government will financially support a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial by Universidad Catolica and Sinovac that is entering phase three of clinical trials. Authorities suggest that the vaccine could be ready by 2021.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 28, Chile began gradually lifting lockdown restrictions in Santiago. As part of the Chilean government’s Testing Traceability and Isolation strategy, the Undersecretary of Public Health and Mayor of Las Condes conducted an Active Search procedure on July 29. This procedure performs PCR testing on pedestrians in communes that have entered the Transition phase, or phase two, of reopening. Las Condes was one of the communes that entered phase two and which began daily testing in communes. The government also expects people to prove residency if they are moving around in communes in the Transition phase. The Undersecretary for Children and the Undersecretary for Public Health met with the Chilean Society of Pediatrics and other health experts to determine how permits should work for children and adolescents to leave home during the pandemic and when and where they should be permitted to go. The government’s decision to reopen has been criticized by medical experts in Chile who claim that the country is not ready to reopen.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government is promoting two ventilators that were developed in Chile as part of their COVID-19 response. The government also released a program called Territorial Viewer to show infections per square kilometer, quarantines, sanitary cordons and other indicators related to the presence of COVID-19 in Chile. The viewer will help the government identify areas that require attention and areas where PCR should be prioritized. In a July 21 report, President Pinera explained that reopening would proceed gradually, consider community opinions, incorporate WHO recommendations and consider district and regional differences -- particularly regarding regional and district abilities to comply with health criteria. Pinera also suggested that Chile would allow areas to reintroduce lockdown measures if necessary. The first phase of reopening is “quarantine”; it limits mobility, requires permits for movement, and closes gyms, classes, theaters and more. The second phase is “transitional”; it allows for increased movement but includes quarantines on weekends and some other limitations. While the government released its reopening plan on July 19 and said that the situation had improved in 12 regions, it did not reveal when Santiago and northern mining regions would reopen. As of July 27, 65 communities and territories were in the quarantine phase, zero were in the transition phase, 266 were in the preparation phase and 22 were in the initial opening phase. On July 28, Chile’s capital will ease some lockdown restrictions. The government will allow children and people 75 years and older to leave home.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 14, there were approximately 453 ventilators available and 5,771 patients in the 154 sanitary residences—with 10,088 vacancies remaining. Chile has reported a drop in positive cases; the past week showed a 15% drop in new cases and the past two weeks showed a 36% drop. The rate of positive PCR tests is decreasing; it was 15% as of July 14. The government advises Chileans to be cautious in Aysen and Los Rios, where confinement began ending on July 13 and reopening is voluntary. On July 19, Chile released a five stage reopening plan from total quarantine to advanced reopening that will be based on epidemiological criteria, healthcare capacity and case traceability for each territory. The first phase is quarantine with limited mobility, permits for movement, and closure of gyms, classes, theaters and more. The second phase is transitional with increased movement, but includes quarantines on weekends and some other limitations. Professional soccer players, referees and high-performance athletes such as athletes training for the Olympics will have collective permits with capacity limits that allow teams in areas under quarantine to resume training. During the week of July 6, a record of approximately 15,410 people were detained for health regulation violations.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 6, Chile had the sixth-most COVID-19 patients globally: 3000 new cases and 76 dead in 24 hours. The innovative PPE that won an April COVID-19 innovation challenge and a newly designed ventilator will be tested in health centers. Latin American and Caribbean representatives, the IMF and the World Bank are collaborating on pandemic response. From July 7 to 21, the government implemented a sanitary cordon in la Tirana to prevent a religious festival. In urban and populated areas, masks will be mandatory in public. The government wants to increase PCR testing abilities in the metropolitan area. In response to a 20% decline in the rate of positive COVID-19 test results between June 16 and July 8, the government will announce a national reopening plan. Until then, reopening will only be in places with few cases over a prolonged period, low incidence, strong contact tracing, no increase in cases and a good healthcare system. The metropolitan areas are among the most affected parts of Chile; they are seeing a decrease in cases and are working on a gradual reopening plan that educates Chileans and requires masks and social distancing. On July 13, five of 22 sanitary protection measures will be lifted in Aysen and Los Rios. These measures will reopen cinemas and restaurants at 25% capacity, non-elective surgeries, sports events with 10 participants indoors or 50 participants outdoors, and allow adults over the age of 75 to go outside with permits. A sanitary cordon that separates these regions was installed on July 10. An epidemiologist said that COVID-19 rates in Chile do not support relaxing health measures and that the country should wait until it has a 10% positivity rate and fewer cases before reopening.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 30, Chile reported over 3,300 new cases in one day--with 389 people in critical condition and 293 ventilators still available. As of June 30, Chile had conducted 1,109,792 PCR tests. Chile is beginning to see a decline in its COVID-19 positivity rate. On June 26, additional municipalities entered quarantine. Cordons sanitaires were enforced for the June 27 long weekend in some areas. Requests for temporary permits to leave home during quarantine have decreased. On June 26, Chile received 82 new ventilators and PPE was sent to laboratories that assess PCR tests. The Ministry of Health is introducing a new platform to improve contact tracing capabilities and data collection for health care professionals. The Chilean government is funding 63 research projects on COVID-19 and its impact on social structures like education and work. The government will also support engineering technology projects for AI and prediction. On July 1, middle school students in Rapa Nui (Easter Island) returned in person; on July 8 basic education will resume and on July 15 kindergarten will resume. The number of people detained for violating curfew saw a small decrease.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 19, the Santiago metropolitan region was ranked the fourth area globally for the most COVID-19 cases.  The country was ranked ninth for the most COVID-19 cases and 20th for the most deaths. On June 19 and 24, additional quarantines were implemented. On June 19, additional restrictive measures were implemented in some quarantined areas. The health minister does not want a complete hibernation because of the need to satisfy essential services, food needs, the needs of seniors and medical needs, therefore they are exploring escalating lockdown measures to increase compliance. Some of the stricter measures include reducing the number of permits for movement from five to two weekly, offering permits for people to make funeral and medical preparations, asking essential companies to reduce the number of people working in person and others. Critics describe that while the government prepared health materials early in the outbreak, they did not account for poverty: the difficulty of people isolating in dense cities, underlying health conditions, the need for people to work so that they can buy food, and a lack of access to (high-speed) internet.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chile reported the ninth most cases in the world. The Minister of Health anticipates that June will be Chile’s most difficult month during the pandemic and anticipates that 13% of the population will be hospitalized. Between May 11 and June 9, a record of 6,498 Chileans died, which is the most deaths in any one month over the past ten years. GenoSur, a Chilean biotechnology firm, is working with an American company in Miami to produce sampling collection kits and transport devices for COVID-19. As of June 12, additional quarantine measures were introduced in urban areas while quarantines were extended in other regions. A minister confirmed that the country’s state of emergency will be extended for another 90 days, with continued sanitary controls, curfews and army presence. Between June 11 and 12, fewer Chileans were detained for curfew violations. Amid rising new daily cases and death tolls, and scandals about COVID-19 case reporting discrepancies, Minister of Health Jaime Manalich resigned and was replaced by Enrique Paris. An Activa Research Citizen Pulso poll suggests that the president’s approval ratings rose to 13.6% while his cabinet’s rejection ratings fell to 79.2% compared to May’s poll results.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chile has one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in Latin America and to ensure comparability and accuracy in their count, they will now include information found on death certificates. After approximately 76 days under partial or total lockdown, Chile’s hospitals are close to collapsing. 75 people, two of whom had tested positive for COVID-19, were detained and face fines for violating lockdown regulations. Chile is making permits in regions that are under lockdown stricter to deter the abuse of permits and will be extending lockdowns in Chile. Chile is increasing the number of hospital transport vans, the number of critical care beds in hospitals and the number of sanitary residences used for self-isolation. The government donated masks, gloves and sanitizer to a group of taxi drivers in the Metropolitan Region. The government supported the University of Chile’s launch of a free traceability course based on the John Hopkins contact tracing course. On July 31, the National Professional Football Association intends to resume football games after three to four weeks of training camp.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chile has over 100,000 cases and had a new peak of daily deaths from COVID-19 on June 2 with 75. Santiago and 38 towns in the area continue to be under lockdown. Chile received 65 more ventilators on May 29. To meet a government goal of increased hospital patient capacity, hospitals are converting other departments to accommodate more beds and more ventilators. The Ministry of Health is also trying to increase their capacities in testing, patient treatment and isolation with more sanitary residences. Through public-private collaborations, more PPE will be delivered to nursing homes. Major cities in the country remain under lockdown. As of Friday May 29, Chile reported their highest number of deaths in one day at 49 deaths, the government expects the rising trend to continue without proper distancing and lockdown measures being respected.  The government released a National Tourism Plan to offer support and guidance for protocols in restimulating the tourism sector.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chile is currently experiencing growing numbers of daily cases and on May 25th had 3709 new daily cases. In Latin America, Chile has the third most COVID-19 patients with approximately 82,200 cases and 840 dead. Chile is consequently facing speculations of a collapsing health care system where treatment is becoming more selective between patients that can and cannot be saved. This distinction between patients is growing in Santiago.Between May 23-27, Chile received more ventilators and PPE. Chile began integrating high flow oxygen therapy into their treatment plans and is teaching this therapy in universities. The government implemented new health measures that included converting more beds to accommodate a higher ICU capacity and increasing sanitary residences to facilitate quarantining for Chileans. To further increase health care capacity by 500 beds, Chile is creating 5 modular hospitals, with the first one expected to be ready in June. Despite plans to begin reopening borders, schools, and workplaces in May, a large portion of the country remains closed. The President reduced the salaries of authorities and public officials and Congress was granted permission to operate virtually.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">All of Santiago is now under quarantine due to a recent uptick in cases; this is an expansion of the country’s earlier strategy to use dynamic or selective quarantines, as opposed to quarantining entire cities. Further restrictions were imposed on quarantined regions, including Santiago, where people now have five permits to go outside weekly, only two of which can be used on the supermarket. Children cannot go between their parents’ households, if they live separately, and there will be no more permits to change addresses. Approximately 33,000 people have been detained for violating curfews and approximately 1,401 people have been detained for violating health restrictions. As of May 21st, Chile registered its highest number of daily deaths at 45. Chile received more ventilators from Holland and China. The use of hyperimmune plasma treatment, which uses antibodies from a recovered patient to treat someone who is still ill, had its first success in Chile at curing a COVID-19 patient. Chilean officials expressed that they do not want to relax restrictions until there is a  consistent two to three week long drop in cases and instead will focus on increasing treatment capacity. Clashes between protestors and police erupted over food shortages in Santiago.</p>
