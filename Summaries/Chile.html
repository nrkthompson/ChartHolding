The country was ranked ninth for the most COVID-19 cases and 20th for the most deaths. On June 19 and 24, additional quarantines were implemented. On June 19, additional restrictive measures were implemented in some quarantined areas. The health minister does not want a complete hibernation because of the need to satisfy essential services, food needs, the needs of seniors and medical needs, therefore they are exploring escalating lockdown measures to increase compliance. Some of the stricter measures include reducing the number of permits for movement from five to two weekly, offering permits for people to make funeral and medical preparations, asking essential companies to reduce the number of people working in person and others. Critics describe that while the government prepared health materials early in the outbreak, they did not account for poverty: the difficulty of people isolating in dense cities, underlying health conditions, the need for people to work so that they can buy food, and a lack of access to (high-speed) internet.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chile reported the ninth most cases in the world. The Minister of Health anticipates that June will be Chile’s most difficult month during the pandemic and anticipates that 13% of the population will be hospitalized. Between May 11 and June 9, a record of 6,498 Chileans died, which is the most deaths in any one month over the past ten years. GenoSur, a Chilean biotechnology firm, is working with an American company in Miami to produce sampling collection kits and transport devices for COVID-19.

  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chile has one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in Latin America and to ensure comparability and accuracy in their count, they will now include information found on death certificates. After approximately 76 days under partial or total lockdown, Chile’s hospitals are close to collapsing. 75 people, two of whom had tested positive for COVID-19, were detained and face fines for violating lockdown regulations. Chile is making permits in regions that are under lockdown stricter to deter the abuse of permits and will be extending lockdowns in Chile. Chile is increasing the number of hospital transport vans, the number of critical care beds in hospitals and the number of sanitary residences used for self-isolation. The government donated masks, gloves and sanitizer to a group of taxi drivers in the Metropolitan Region. The government supported the University of Chile’s launch of a free traceability course based on the John Hopkins contact tracing course.

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chile has over 100,000 cases and had a new peak of daily deaths from COVID-19 on June 2 with 75. Santiago and 38 towns in the area continue to be under lockdown. Chile received 65 more ventilators on May 29. To meet a government goal of increased hospital patient capacity, hospitals are converting other departments to accommodate more beds and more ventilators. The Ministry of Health is also trying to increase their capacities in testing, patient treatment and isolation with more sanitary residences. Through public-private collaborations, more PPE will be delivered to nursing homes. Major cities in the country remain under lockdown. As of Friday May 29, Chile reported their highest number of deaths in one day at 49 deaths, the government expects the rising trend to continue without proper distancing and lockdown measures being respected.

  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chile is currently experiencing growing numbers of daily cases and on May 25th had 3709 new daily cases. In Latin America, Chile has the third most COVID-19 patients with approximately 82,200 cases and 840 dead. Chile is consequently facing speculations of a collapsing health care system where treatment is becoming more selective between patients that can and cannot be saved. This distinction between patients is growing in Santiago.Between May 23-27, Chile received more ventilators and PPE. Chile began integrating high flow oxygen therapy into their treatment plans and is teaching this therapy in universities. The government implemented new health measures that included converting more beds to accommodate a higher ICU capacity and increasing sanitary residences to facilitate quarantining for Chileans. To further increase health care capacity by 500 beds, Chile is creating 5 modular hospitals, with the first one expected to be ready in June. Despite plans to begin reopening borders, schools, and workplaces in May, a large portion of the country remains closed.

  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">All of Santiago is now under quarantine due to a recent uptick in cases; this is an expansion of the country’s earlier strategy to use dynamic or selective quarantines, as opposed to quarantining entire cities. Further restrictions were imposed on quarantined regions, including Santiago, where people now have five permits to go outside weekly, only two of which can be used on the supermarket. Children cannot go between their parents’ households, if they live separately, and there will be no more permits to change addresses. Approximately 33,000 people have been detained for violating curfews and approximately 1,401 people have been detained for violating health restrictions. As of May 21st, Chile registered its highest number of daily deaths at 45. Chile received more ventilators from Holland and China. The use of hyperimmune plasma treatment, which uses antibodies from a recovered patient to treat someone who is still ill, had its first success in Chile at curing a COVID-19 patient. Chilean officials expressed that they do not want to relax restrictions until there is a  consistent two to three week long drop in cases and instead will focus on increasing treatment capacity. Clashes between protestors and police erupted over food shortages in Santiago.</p>
