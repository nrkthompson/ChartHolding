      Chile has one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in Latin America and to ensure comparability and accuracy in their count, they will now include information found on death certificates. After approximately 76 days under partial or total lockdown, Chile’s hospitals are close to collapsing. 75 people, two of whom had tested positive for COVID-19, were detained and face fines for violating lockdown regulations. Chile is making permits in regions that are under lockdown stricter to deter the abuse of permits and will be extending lockdowns in Chile. Chile is increasing the number of hospital transport vans, the number of critical care beds in hospitals and the number of sanitary residences used for self-isolation. The government donated masks, gloves and sanitizer to a group of taxi drivers in the Metropolitan Region. The government supported the University of Chile’s launch of a free traceability course based on the John Hopkins contact tracing course. On July 31, the National Professional Football Association intends to resume football games after three to four weeks of training camp.

Chile received 65 more ventilators on May 29.

Through public-private collaborations, more PPE will be delivered to nursing homes. Major cities in the country remain under lockdown.

      Chile is currently experiencing growing numbers of daily cases and on May 25th had 3709 new daily cases. In Latin America, Chile has the third most COVID-19 patients with approximately 82,200 cases and 840 dead. Chile is consequently facing speculations of a collapsing health care system where treatment is becoming more selective between patients that can and cannot be saved. This distinction between patients is growing in Santiago.Between May 23-27, Chile received more ventilators and PPE. Chile began integrating high flow oxygen therapy into their treatment plans and is teaching this therapy in universities. The government implemented new health measures that included converting more beds to accommodate a higher ICU capacity and increasing sanitary residences to facilitate quarantining for Chileans. To further increase health care capacity by 500 beds, Chile is creating 5 modular hospitals, with the first one expected to be ready in June. Despite plans to begin reopening borders, schools, and workplaces in May, a large portion of the country remains closed. The President reduced the salaries of authorities and public officials and Congress was granted permission to operate virtually.

      All of Santiago is now under quarantine due to a recent uptick in cases; this is an expansion of the country’s earlier strategy to use dynamic or selective quarantines, as opposed to quarantining entire cities. Further restrictions were imposed on quarantined regions, including Santiago, where people now have five permits to go outside weekly, only two of which can be used on the supermarket. Children cannot go between their parents’ households, if they live separately, and there will be no more permits to change addresses. Approximately 33,000 people have been detained for violating curfews and approximately 1,401 people have been detained for violating health restrictions. As of May 21st, Chile registered its highest number of daily deaths at 45. Chile received more ventilators from Holland and China. The use of hyperimmune plasma treatment, which uses antibodies from a recovered patient to treat someone who is still ill, had its first success in Chile at curing a COVID-19 patient. Chilean officials expressed that they do not want to relax restrictions until there is a  consistent two to three week long drop in cases and instead will focus on increasing treatment capacity. Clashes between protestors and police erupted over food shortages in Santiago.
