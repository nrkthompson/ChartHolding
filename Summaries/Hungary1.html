      On May 18, the Hungarian government lifted curfew restrictions in Budapest and Pest counties, thereby ending Hungary’s nationwide lockdown; curfew restrictions were lifted in the rest of the country two weeks earlier, on May 4. Restrictions related to COVID-19 continue to be eased around Hungary after the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly dubbed the country’s response to COVID-19, “the most successful in Europe.” As of May 18, Hungarian residents have been allowed to visit all parks, outdoor spaces, shops, beaches, spas, and outdoor baths. All catering establishments are being allowed to complete sales and seat customers indoors, and all religious services, funerals, and weddings are being permitted. Post-secondary academic institutions have also been allowed to reopen, subject to the individual decisions of their respective deans or directors. Guidelines related to personal hygiene and physical distancing, including wearing a mask or scarf in shops and on public transportation, continue to apply to all Hungarian residents indefinitely.
