      Tourism season officially began in Greece on June 15 with seasonal hotels, museums, historic buildings, and entertainment parks opening to visitors. Also, international flights will resume to Athens and Thessaloniki airports. Travellers arriving from airports deemed high risk by the EASA will be tested upon arrival and could face quarantines, however, for other travellers there are no requirements and they may only be subject to random testing.89 Direct flights between international destinations and the islands will not resume until July 1, along with direct flights between the US and Greece. The government is implementing several measures which include testing facilities on the islands, designated doctors for each hotel and quarantine zones for those who test positive.90 An increase in the number of cases among several municipalities has led authorities to impose a curfew and restrictions on gatherings and  travel.  Since Greece has opened its doors to international visitors, resurgence is a concern and authorities are implementing strict measures to avoid outbreaks in cities or tourist areas where there may be crowds. 91The prime minister said Greece will be prepared in the event of a second wave because of social distancing, protective measures and additional ICU hospital beds.92
