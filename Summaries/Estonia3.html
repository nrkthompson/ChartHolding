      A number of restrictions were lifted in Estonia this week as the country moves toward a new normal. Restaurants and bars are now permitted to return to normal operating hours, and public events of up to 100 people are now allowed. Residents of 20 European countries may now travel freely throughout Estonia without self-isolating first as their infection rate in the last two weeks has remained below 15 new infections per 100,000 people. Travellers must have spent at least the previous two weeks in one of the eligible countries in order to avoid quarantine measures. Citizens of other Schengen Area countries (and the United Kingdom) may travel to Estonia, but must undergo a two-week quarantine upon arrival. The Science Council has indicated that they may remove the mandatory social distancing order at some point this summer if infection rates continue to drop. However, the Head of the Health Board’s Emergency Medicine has said that the government expects Estonians to follow their recommendations even if they are not mandatory.
