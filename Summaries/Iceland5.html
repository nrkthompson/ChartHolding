      Up to 500 people are now able to gather in Iceland in the country’s most recent lifting of restrictions, with fitness centres and swimming pools able to return to full capacity. Over 900 air passengers arrived in Iceland on June 15 after the country allowed access to tourists from the EU/EEA, of whom two tested positive for coronavirus and are now in isolation. The government issued new guidelines for tourists who opt to quarantine rather than get tested at the airport, saying they are subject to deportation for violating the rules and may deny them entry if they are deemed to be likely violators. The Director of Health said that the country would be able to carry on testing for COVID-19 even if nurses go on strike on June 22, as other healthcare professionals can perform the test. The Head of the Nurses’ Union fought back against this assertion, saying that the Director’s statement undermines nursing as a profession and expressing her hope that other healthcare workers will not cross the picket line in the event of a strike.
