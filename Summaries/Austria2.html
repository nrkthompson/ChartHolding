      Effective May 29, leisure attractions such as zoos and swimming pools will be allowed to reopen in Austria. Despite several airports being operational, limited services are available and international travel is limited until May 31. In an effort to encourage tourists to visit Austria this summer, the government has planned to expand testing to screen hotel staff, with hotels set to reopen on May 29. As of July 1, private labs will be utilized to test 65,000 hotel workers weekly. Effective May 26, the Czech Republic opened its borders with Austria, putting an end to border checks for residents. Cross-border travel will be permitted with other countries - such as Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Hungary - by June 15. Travellers must carry evidence of a negative test, and those without one must self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. All major events remain prohibited, and people cannot gather in groups larger than 10. Austria’s President, Alexander Van der Bellen, has apologized after breaching the government’s COVID-10 imposed curfew of 11pm, which has enabled restaurants and cafes to reopen.
