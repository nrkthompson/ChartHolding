      Restrictions related to COVID-19 continue to be eased throughout Hungary after its Chief Medical Officer declared that the country’s epidemic had “clearly come to an end.” All eateries are allowed to serve and seat customers indoors, and all religious services, funerals, and weddings are permitted. Post-secondary academic institutions are also allowed to reopen, subject to the individual decisions of their respective deans or directors. The Hungarian government has continued easing land border restrictions with neighboring countries that demonstrate favourable epidemiological situations. On May 27, land borders between Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic reopened to citizens travelling across each respective border for up to 48 hours at a time. As of May 28, citizens from Hungary and Slovenia were permitted to cross each other's borders without restrictions. To a large extent, domestic tourism has also resumed, with the vast majority of hotels and accommodative establishments, spas, and tourist attractions fully reopening on June 1. Guidelines related to personal hygiene and physical distancing continue to apply to all Hungarian residents indefinitely.
