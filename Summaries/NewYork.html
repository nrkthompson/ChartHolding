  <h5>February 1, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On January 31, New York reported 7,976 hospitalizations and a statewide positivity rate of 4.44%. The statewide positivity rate has declined for 23 consecutive days. The governor announced that indoor dining at 25% capacity would be allowed to resume in New York City on February 14. All restaurants must adhere to the statewide closing time of 10 pm. Larger wedding ceremonies may resume throughout the state on March 15 if approved by the local health department, all guests are tested, and there is a limit of 150 people or 50% capacity -- whichever is lower. The mayor of New York City said that local officials have set a goal of vaccinating five million city residents by the end of June. A report released by the state attorney general’s office said that the state government had undercounted the number of deaths from COVID-19 in nursing homes by as much as 50%. The report said that a death was only counted if it took place in the nursing home itself, and the total did not include those who were hospitalized and died there. The governor and the state health commissioner denied that they were deliberately undercounting the deaths.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of January 24, the statewide test positivity rate in New York was 5.09%. There were 8,613 hospitalizations. However, 54 ZIP codes in New York City have reported 7-day average positivity rates above 10%, with the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island all reporting borough-wide positivity rates above 9%. Public health officials in the city have urged at-risk individuals to only leave home for essential purposes, with some calling for further restrictions to combat the spread. The governor sent a letter to the CEO of Pfizer asking to purchase doses of the vaccine directly now that the company is no longer a part of the federal Operation Warp Speed. The governor also said that the state would run out of vaccine doses this week, specifically citing the delayed delivery schedule as the root cause. Both the governor and the mayor of New York City said that they were hopeful that the new Biden administration would expand their ability to access doses.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of January 17, the statewide test positivity rate in New York is 5.61%. There are 8,771 hospitalized COVID-19 patients statewide. The governor announced that indoor dining would be able to resume in most of the state following a court decision that allowed restaurants in the Buffalo area to reopen. Indoor dining, with a 50% capacity limit, will be permitted in all Orange Zones, including in Syracuse and Rochester. The governor’s office criticized the decision, indicating an intention to appeal. The mayor of New York City said that local healthcare providers would run out of their vaccine supply early next week and urged state and federal officials to provide the city with more doses. Several large hospitals have cancelled thousands of upcoming appointments.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs statewide positivity rate has increased to 5.18%, as of December 19. Hospitalizations continue to increase, with 6,208 beds filled with COVID-19 patients. The stateÕs 7-day rolling average is now 10,500 cases per day, which is higher than the peak during the first wave when New York City was considered a global epicenter. Nevertheless, no new statewide restrictions have been introduced.  Bars, restaurants and gyms may open but must close in-person service from 10 pm to 5 am daily. Indoor and outdoor gatherings at private residences are limited to no more than 10 people. On December 20, the governor called on the federal government to consider action against the highly contagious variant of COVID-19 circulating in the United Kingdom -- including by imposing mandatory testing of individuals traveling from the UK on flights to the US.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs statewide positivity rate increased to 4.98% as of December 13. For the first time since May, the number of hospitalizations surpassed 5,000: it now stands at 5,321 patients statewide -- with 1,007 patients in the ICU and 546 of them on a ventilator. On December 12, 106 New Yorkers died due to COVID-19. On December 11, the governor announced new rules to trigger the various COVID-19 restrictions and colour zones in New York State. A "Red zone" will go into effect if a region is 21 days from 90% hospital capacity, an "Orange zone" will go into effect if a region is over 4% positivity over the past 10 days, and a "Yellow zone" will go into effect when there is 3% positivity over the past 10 days. As of December 14, indoor dining was shut down in New York City. Other restrictions are being studied.  Data show that gyms are responsible for .06% of the spread, hair and personal care are responsible for .14%, and restaurants are responsible for 1.43%.  Indoor gatherings in private homes, by contrast, were found to account for 74% of COVID-19 spread.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs positivity rate is 6.22% in Òfocus zoneÓ areas and 4.71% statewide. Hospitalization and ICU occupancy rates are increasing, as are deaths, but the governor is continuing his micro-cluster strategy. A survey showed that more than half of New York City firefighters would refuse the vaccine. As of December 7, some NYC schools are phasing out hybrid learning and moving toward resuming in-person classes on December 7.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs positivity rate is 5.83% in Òfocus zoneÓ areas, and 3.75% outside those areas. The state is now conducting roughly 220,000 tests per day. Based on an increased positivity rate, new Yellow Precautionary Zones will be established in Upper Manhattan and Nassau and Suffolk Counties. New York City schools will begin phasing out hybrid learning and move toward resuming in-person classes on December 7, after citywide shutdowns on November 19 due to the city's seven-day positivity rate of more than 3%.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs positivity rate is 4.34% in Òfocus zoneÓ areas, and 2.49% outside those areas. The state is now conducting roughly 200,000 tests per day. The governor announced that Rockland County's Yellow Precautionary Zone will be expanded, and parts of Orange and Westchester counties will become Yellow Precautionary Zones due to increased cases, positivity, and hospital admissions from these areas. On November 17, New York City passed its threshold of 3% positivity rate. As of November 19, the mayor halted in-person learning, sending more than one million children into all-online classes at least through Thanksgiving. The city hasn't yet settled on criteria for reopening classrooms, but the mayor said this would involve increasing virus testing of children at schools and allowing students to return only if their parents consented to that testing.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs positivity rate is 4.05% in Òfocus zoneÓ areas, and 2.45% outside those areas. On November 13, the state reported over 200,000 COVID-19 test results, a new record. The governor announced that Rockland County's orange warning zone will transition to a yellow precautionary zone. New York CityÕs positivity rate is still below the school closure threshold, which is 3%; the total statewide positivity rate is 2.74%.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs positivity rate is 3.72% in Òfocus zoneÓ areas and 2.23% outside those areas. The governor is concerned with the slight increase since last week: the target is a 1% positivity rate. The micro-cluster strategy continues to be a success as red zones in Brooklyn and Queens start to reopen. Rockland's red zone has seen its positivity rate decline from 9.8% to 3.6%, meeting the metrics for transitioning from a red zone to an orange warning zone. Last week, the governor announced new guidelines allowing out-of-state travellers to New York to waive the mandatory 14-day quarantine by getting tested on day four after their arrival. If that test comes back negative, the traveller may exit quarantine. As expected, ski resorts began opening for the season on November 6, with restrictions, such as 50% capacity indoors and capacity on mountains reduced to 25% during "peak" days.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs positivity rate is 3.10% in Òfocus zoneÓ areas, and 1.36% outside those areas. New York had the highest positivity rate in the nation at the peak of the first wave, and now it has the third lowest. The "Red Zone" micro-cluster focus area of Orange County has met the metrics required to shift it to the "Orange Warning Zone." Orange CountyÕs micro-cluster zone positivity rate has gone from 12% to 2% in three weeks and the rate of new daily hospital admissions has flattened. The governor released guidelines for schools reopening in a red or orange micro-cluster zone. To reopen, schools must remain closed for at least four calendar days after the zone designation is announced, and ensure that no person, including staff, faculty and students, may attend in-person on the campus without first receiving a negative test result.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs positivity rate continues to hover around 1%, as the state adopts a micro-cluster lockdown strategy. The Governor noted that the positive testing rate in all focus areas under the state's micro-cluster strategy is 3.18%, and outside the focus zone areas is 1.06%. With the enhanced focused testing of this strategy, the positivity rates in Brooklyn, Rockland and Orange Counties are all down this week. Once those areas return to at least 1% positivity with regular testing capacity, then their businesses will open up again. Movie theaters outside of New York City opened on October 23, with 25% capacity, and no more than 50 people in front of each movie screen.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs positivity rate continues to hover around 1%, as the state adopts a micro-cluster lockdown strategy. The strategy, developed alongside public health officials, has three steps: refined detection, specific and calibrated mitigation, and focused enforcement. Areas with the highest concentration of COVID-19 cases will face the harshest restrictions, whereas surrounding communities will see fewer restrictions, acting as a buffer to ensure the virus does not spread beyond the central focus area. Enhanced focused testing and enforcement will follow. On October 18, the governor announced that ski resorts may open on November 6 with 50% indoor capacity. Masks will be required everywhere when not eating, drinking or skiing, and lifts are restricted to members of the same party. As well, movie theaters outside of New York City may open on October 23, with 25% capacity, and no more than 50 people in front of each movie screen.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New YorkÕs positivity rate dropped to 0.96% yesterday, under 1% for the first time since September 24. After schools fully reopened in person by October 1, New York is shutting down Òtiny areasÓ of up to two square miles in metropolitan areas to prevent a widespread breakout like the state experienced in the spring. These areas, called Òzones,Ó are required to close nonessential businesses, religious congregations, schools, and indoor dining for at least 2 weeks. Most zones are located in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New York has increased its testing capacity to 120,000 tests per day, as the state is coping with early signs of a surge. On September 29, elementary school students went back to classrooms across New York City, with middle and high schools following suit on October 1. Families have the option of choosing all-remote learning, and 48% of families have chosen to do as of October 2, up from 30% six weeks earlier. Simultaneously, New York City restaurants reopened their indoor dining areas on September 30 at reduced capacity. Nevertheless, as COVID-19 cases surged over the weekend in local clusters, Mayor Bill de Blasio is now seeking state approval for local lockdowns in nine ZIP codes where COVID-19 positivity rates have spiked. Local lockdown measures would include shutting non-essential businesses as well as schools in those nine neighborhoods identified as hotspots in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New York continues to report around 800-900 new cases per day. Starting September 30th, restaurants with indoor seating can reopen with a 25% occupancy limit. Indoor pools will also be allowed to reopen on the same day, although with strict occupancy limits of 33% of capacity. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City says that students in grade 3 and above will phase in by grade level through October 1, though the details of this plan remain vague. On September 21, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced an Executive Order extending the state's moratorium on COVID-29 related commercial evictions and foreclosures an additional month, until October 20.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New York continues to enjoy a COVID-19 test positivity rate below 1 percent.  The state processed over 100,000 tests daily in the past week. Starting September 30, restaurants with indoor seating can reopen with a 25% occupancy limit. Indoor pools will also be allowed to reopen on the same day, although with strict occupancy limits of 33% of their capacity. Although New York City students were scheduled to begin in-person instruction on September 21, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on September 18 that only the youngest students, in 3-K and Pre-K, and those with significant special needs, would be coming back on the 21st. The return of the remaining students will be phased in by grade level through October 1 -- though the details of this plan are still vague.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the state announced its 33rd straight day with a COVID-19 infection rate below 1%, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has allowed indoor dining in New York City to resume. Starting September 30, restaurants with indoor seating can reopen with a 25% occupancy limit. Temperature checks, masks and contact information for tracing will be required, and restaurants must close by midnight. Bar service will not be permitted. If the infection rate does not increase by November 1, the occupancy limit will increase to 50%. New York City students are scheduled to begin in-person instruction on Sept. 21, but the death of teachers in three other states since school resumed has generated a new wave of concern for school boards across the state.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">For the 16th day in a row, New York’s rate of positive tests has been less than 1 percent. Hospitalizations and ICU admissions continue to decrease. Starting August 24, gyms and fitness centers reopened to local officials who will assess the health and safety standards of the locations; they can then open the public by September 2. Gyms can reopen at 33 percent capacity.  Clients are required to wear masks at all times. Also on August 24, museums will reopen in New York City, where capacity will be limited to 25% and visits timed and staggered. NY Governor Cuomo said that New York's stable COVID transmission rate, which has remained at or below 1 percent since the reopening, was key to his decision.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 17, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced guidelines for the reopening of gyms. Bowling alleys are now allowed to reopen at 50 percent capacity, with every other lane closed, mandatory face coverings, and a prohibition on food and drink services. Gyms will likely operate under reduced capacity and more frequent cleaning. Museums have been approved to reopen in New York City on August 24. Capacity will be limited to 25% and visits will be staggered. Cuomo said New York's stable COVID transmission rate, which has remained at or below 1 since the reopening, was key to his decision.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New York continues to keep COVID-19 metrics low, with a 0.78% positivity rate. Over the weekend, the State Liquor Authority and State Police Task Force recorded violations of state laws (indoor service and serving alcohol without food) at 60 establishments. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on August 7 that all school districts in the state can reopen for in-person teaching if the district chooses to do so. However, he acknowledged that there is “significant anxiety” among teachers and parents in taking this collective step. New York’s threshold for keeping schools open is a 3 percent COVID positive rate. On August 9, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that 74% of the city’s students will take part in a mix of in-person and online learning; the remaining students will do all learning online. New York City’s public school teachers, citing safety concerns, are calling for schools to remain closed this fall and for a continuation of online learning.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 4, for the second day in a row, no COVID-related deaths have been recorded in New York City. Over the weekend, the State Liquor Authority and State Police Task Force recorded violations of state laws (indoor service and serving alcohol without food) at 134 establishments. With regards to school reopenings in the fall, Governor Andrew Cuomo will make an announcement in the coming week.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After one week in Phase 4, New York is reporting a 1% positivity rate of COVID-19 tests and single-digit deaths over the weekend. New York City was the last county to enter Phase 4, though it was under additional restrictions compared with the rest of the state. In NYC, indoor eateries and bars are still not open due to the outbreaks raging elsewhere in the world linked to their reopening. Officials banned the sale of alcohol last week to customers who did not buy food simultaneously, in an attempt to crack down on crowds of outdoor drinkers. On July 26, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that more than 100 bars and restaurants in the NYC area were flagged for social distancing violations this weekend, including employees not wearing masks and serving to-go alcohol. Establishments that get three warnings will be stripped of their liquor licenses indefinitely.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite increasing infections throughout the United States, New York continues to show progress combatting COVID-19 with low numbers of new hospitalizations and a low rate of positive cases. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York City will enter a limited version of the state’s fourth phase of reopening starting July 20. While indoor dining, malls, museums and cultural institutions will remain closed, outdoor venues like zoos and botanical gardens will be allowed to operate at a limited capacity. Moreover, NYC will allow for gatherings of up to 50 people, as well as indoor religious gatherings with capacity limits. Outdoor TV and film production and professional sports events without spectators can also resume. The state is tackling an increase in “mask-off parties,” where thousands of people gather in close proximity without wearing masks.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Once considered to be the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, on July 12 New York reported zero COVID-related deaths for the first time since March. Although most metrics (including ICU admissions) remain stable or are improving, Governor Cuomo is warning New Yorkers that the state will likely experience a slight resurgence in cases as the virus moves back north. At this point, New York City is still in Phase 3; all other counties are in Phase 4. New York City's public libraries reopened on July 13.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, the number of active cases began to decrease. The test positivity rate averaged at below 1%.  While the rest of the state is well into phase 4, New York City is entering Phase 3 of its reopening plan on July 6. In this phase, tattoo parlors, nail salons and other contact services can reopen, but indoor dining is still off-limits. Since face masks should be worn at all times, personal care services that require customers to remove face coverings, like facial waxing or piercings, are prohibited. Businesses that cannot accommodate physical distancing will be tasked with requiring employees to get tested for COVID-19 every 14 days, in addition to health screenings like symptom questionnaires or temperature checks. New York City’s public libraries will begin reopening on July 13.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While the virus surges in parts of the southern US, New York (once a COVID-19 hotspot) is experiencing a gradual decline of cases and hospitalizations. On June 22, New York City entered phase 2, which saw the reopening of restaurant/bar patios and terraces with extensive guidelines, including mandatory facemasks for clients as they enter the facility. As well, offices can reopen with 50% capacity and 6ft of social distancing between colleagues (facemasks when not social distancing). All indoor retail, hair salons and barbershops can reopen, but malls, nail/tattoo salons, indoor dining service, large event venues, gyms, casinos and movie theaters are still shut down.</p>
