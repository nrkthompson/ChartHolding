  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, the number of active cases began to decrease. The test positivity rate averaged at below 1%.  While the rest of the state is well into phase 4, New York City is entering Phase 3 of its reopening plan on July 6. In this phase, tattoo parlors, nail salons and other contact services can reopen, but indoor dining is still off-limits. Since face masks should be worn at all times, personal care services that require customers to remove face coverings, like facial waxing or piercings, are prohibited. Businesses that cannot accommodate physical distancing will be tasked with requiring employees to get tested for COVID-19 every 14 days, in addition to health screenings like symptom questionnaires or temperature checks. New York City’s public libraries will begin reopening on July 13.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While the virus surges in parts of the southern US, New York (once a COVID-19 hotspot) is experiencing a gradual decline of cases and hospitalizations. On June 22, New York City entered phase 2, which saw the reopening of restaurant/bar patios and terraces with extensive guidelines, including mandatory facemasks for clients as they enter the facility. As well, offices can reopen with 50% capacity and 6ft of social distancing between colleagues (facemasks when not social distancing). All indoor retail, hair salons and barbershops can reopen, but malls, nail/tattoo salons, indoor dining service, large event venues, gyms, casinos and movie theaters are still shut down.</p>
