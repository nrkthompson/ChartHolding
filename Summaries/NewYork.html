  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the state announced its 33rd straight day with a COVID-19 infection rate below 1%, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has allowed indoor dining in New York City to resume. Starting September 30, restaurants with indoor seating can reopen with a 25% occupancy limit. Temperature checks, masks and contact information for tracing will be required, and restaurants must close by midnight. Bar service will not be permitted. If the infection rate does not increase by November 1, the occupancy limit will increase to 50%. New York City students are scheduled to begin in-person instruction on Sept. 21, but the death of teachers in three other states since school resumed has generated a new wave of concern for school boards across the state.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">For the 16th day in a row, New York’s rate of positive tests has been less than 1 percent. Hospitalizations and ICU admissions continue to decrease. Starting August 24, gyms and fitness centers reopened to local officials who will assess the health and safety standards of the locations; they can then open the public by September 2. Gyms can reopen at 33 percent capacity.  Clients are required to wear masks at all times. Also on August 24, museums will reopen in New York City, where capacity will be limited to 25% and visits timed and staggered. NY Governor Cuomo said that New York's stable COVID transmission rate, which has remained at or below 1 percent since the reopening, was key to his decision.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 17, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced guidelines for the reopening of gyms. Bowling alleys are now allowed to reopen at 50 percent capacity, with every other lane closed, mandatory face coverings, and a prohibition on food and drink services. Gyms will likely operate under reduced capacity and more frequent cleaning. Museums have been approved to reopen in New York City on August 24. Capacity will be limited to 25% and visits will be staggered. Cuomo said New York's stable COVID transmission rate, which has remained at or below 1 since the reopening, was key to his decision.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New York continues to keep COVID-19 metrics low, with a 0.78% positivity rate. Over the weekend, the State Liquor Authority and State Police Task Force recorded violations of state laws (indoor service and serving alcohol without food) at 60 establishments. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on August 7 that all school districts in the state can reopen for in-person teaching if the district chooses to do so. However, he acknowledged that there is “significant anxiety” among teachers and parents in taking this collective step. New York’s threshold for keeping schools open is a 3 percent COVID positive rate. On August 9, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that 74% of the city’s students will take part in a mix of in-person and online learning; the remaining students will do all learning online. New York City’s public school teachers, citing safety concerns, are calling for schools to remain closed this fall and for a continuation of online learning.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 4, for the second day in a row, no COVID-related deaths have been recorded in New York City. Over the weekend, the State Liquor Authority and State Police Task Force recorded violations of state laws (indoor service and serving alcohol without food) at 134 establishments. With regards to school reopenings in the fall, Governor Andrew Cuomo will make an announcement in the coming week.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After one week in Phase 4, New York is reporting a 1% positivity rate of COVID-19 tests and single-digit deaths over the weekend. New York City was the last county to enter Phase 4, though it was under additional restrictions compared with the rest of the state. In NYC, indoor eateries and bars are still not open due to the outbreaks raging elsewhere in the world linked to their reopening. Officials banned the sale of alcohol last week to customers who did not buy food simultaneously, in an attempt to crack down on crowds of outdoor drinkers. On July 26, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that more than 100 bars and restaurants in the NYC area were flagged for social distancing violations this weekend, including employees not wearing masks and serving to-go alcohol. Establishments that get three warnings will be stripped of their liquor licenses indefinitely.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite increasing infections throughout the United States, New York continues to show progress combatting COVID-19 with low numbers of new hospitalizations and a low rate of positive cases. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York City will enter a limited version of the state’s fourth phase of reopening starting July 20. While indoor dining, malls, museums and cultural institutions will remain closed, outdoor venues like zoos and botanical gardens will be allowed to operate at a limited capacity. Moreover, NYC will allow for gatherings of up to 50 people, as well as indoor religious gatherings with capacity limits. Outdoor TV and film production and professional sports events without spectators can also resume. The state is tackling an increase in “mask-off parties,” where thousands of people gather in close proximity without wearing masks.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Once considered to be the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, on July 12 New York reported zero COVID-related deaths for the first time since March. Although most metrics (including ICU admissions) remain stable or are improving, Governor Cuomo is warning New Yorkers that the state will likely experience a slight resurgence in cases as the virus moves back north. At this point, New York City is still in Phase 3; all other counties are in Phase 4. New York City's public libraries reopened on July 13.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, the number of active cases began to decrease. The test positivity rate averaged at below 1%.  While the rest of the state is well into phase 4, New York City is entering Phase 3 of its reopening plan on July 6. In this phase, tattoo parlors, nail salons and other contact services can reopen, but indoor dining is still off-limits. Since face masks should be worn at all times, personal care services that require customers to remove face coverings, like facial waxing or piercings, are prohibited. Businesses that cannot accommodate physical distancing will be tasked with requiring employees to get tested for COVID-19 every 14 days, in addition to health screenings like symptom questionnaires or temperature checks. New York City’s public libraries will begin reopening on July 13.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While the virus surges in parts of the southern US, New York (once a COVID-19 hotspot) is experiencing a gradual decline of cases and hospitalizations. On June 22, New York City entered phase 2, which saw the reopening of restaurant/bar patios and terraces with extensive guidelines, including mandatory facemasks for clients as they enter the facility. As well, offices can reopen with 50% capacity and 6ft of social distancing between colleagues (facemasks when not social distancing). All indoor retail, hair salons and barbershops can reopen, but malls, nail/tattoo salons, indoor dining service, large event venues, gyms, casinos and movie theaters are still shut down.</p>
