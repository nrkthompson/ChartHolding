  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While the virus surges in parts of the southern US, New York (once a COVID-19 hotspot) is experiencing a gradual decline of cases and hospitalizations. On June 22, New York City entered phase 2, which saw the reopening of restaurant/bar patios and terraces with extensive guidelines, including mandatory facemasks for clients as they enter the facility. As well, offices can reopen with 50% capacity and 6ft of social distancing between colleagues (facemasks when not social distancing). All indoor retail, hair salons and barbershops can reopen, but malls, nail/tattoo salons, indoor dining service, large event venues, gyms, casinos and movie theaters are still shut down.</p>
