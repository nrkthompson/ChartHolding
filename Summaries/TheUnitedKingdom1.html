      With the highest death rate in Europe, the UK is still far from reaching its daily testing capacity goal of 200,000 by the end of May in order to move ahead with reopening the country in June. To compensate for the lack of testing, Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, said on May 21st that he was confident a COVID-19 track and trace system would be operating by June 1st. The government has recruited 24,000 trackers to manually trace the contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 using telephone and email. This week, Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, revealed his plans to begin the phased reopening of schools on June 1st, beginning with students in nursery, pre-school, and primary school. He is “asking schools to adopt a number of strict protective measures” including reduced class sizes and extending testing. However, teaching unions have said the plans do not have clear, unequivocal, and adequate safety measures, and need to be halted. Some councils (equivalent to school boards) have said their schools will not open, and described the move to bring students back as "madness," vowing to defy Johnson's policies. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that schools would not reopen before August 11th, explaining that large physical spaces, such as community halls, leisure centres, and conference venues, will be used as classrooms to maintain social distancing etiquette between children. Scotland will begin easing restrictions on May 28th, almost 2 weeks after England began its reopening plan. It is worth noting that Australia is in serious talks with the UK to exempt its citizens from UK quarantine when they arrive. This lobbying effort seems to be how the globalized world is moving forward.
