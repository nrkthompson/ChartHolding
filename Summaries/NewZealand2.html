      New Zealand has experienced almost no new cases of COVID-19 as its last in-patient still receiving treatment for the virus is discharged from hospital. New Zealand’s Health Ministry launched a new app providing information to medical professionals on May 27, while some district  health boards have refused to adopt the previous contact tracing app due to concerns over its functionality. Effective May 29, up to 100 people will be allowed to gather in public and private venues - a significant increase from the previous limit of 10. Health authorities have urged event organizers to keep a detailed record of gatherings and their attendees where possible. Employers are being encouraged to consider more flexible work arrangements, including remote work, and longer hours over fewer work days. Air New Zealand is maintaining a significantly reduced flight network until at least the of August. New Zealand’s Prime Minister remains hesitant over opening exclusive travel routes with Australia, and expects that the trans-Tasman travel bubble will not come into being until at least the end of June. Restrictions are being reassessed every 2 weeks, and the country is expected to fully reopen by June 22.
