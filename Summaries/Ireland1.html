      On May 18th, Ireland entered the first stage of its  5 phase roadmap planned  by the government to reopen its economy. In phase 1, unnecessary travel is restricted to all residents, with advice to stay home except for a brief outdoor exercise within 5km of their homes. Golf and tennis courts are permitted to reopen with online booking and adherence to strict policies. For instance, tennis is not allowed to be played in a competitive nature with the presence of an audience, while golf is restricted to allow only three people to play together at once.. Also, people over 70 years of age are highly discouraged from participating in sports. Some construction firms resumed work with the reopening of garden centres and hardware stores. Firms and  workers are expected to comply with the measures set out in the Return to Work Safely Protocol, laid out by the government. The protocol includes a 2 metre distance rule on and off site, along with the application of mask and shield at all times. Other businesses including motor and bike repair shops, opticians, dry cleaners, and phone outlets will also resume work under the same safety procedures. Schools and college buildings reopened to allow teachers to organise remote learning. Some tourist amenities including car parks, beaches, and mountain walks reopened to encourage tourism in the country. With regards to gatherings, four people from different households are permitted to meet outdoors while observing the 2 metre distance rule, whereas funerals are restricted to a maximum of 10 people. The final stage of the roadmap will include plans for the reopening of pubs, effective August 10th.
