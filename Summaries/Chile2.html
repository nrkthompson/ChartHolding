      Chile is currently experiencing growing numbers of daily cases and on May 25th had 3709 new daily cases. In Latin America, Chile has the third most COVID-19 patients with approximately 82,200 cases and 840 dead. Chile is consequently facing speculations of a collapsing health care system where treatment is becoming more selective between patients that can and cannot be saved. This distinction between patients is growing in Santiago.Between May 23-27, Chile received more ventilators and PPE. Chile began integrating high flow oxygen therapy into their treatment plans and is teaching this therapy in universities. The government implemented new health measures that included converting more beds to accommodate a higher ICU capacity and increasing sanitary residences to facilitate quarantining for Chileans. To further increase health care capacity by 500 beds, Chile is creating 5 modular hospitals, with the first one expected to be ready in June. Despite plans to begin reopening borders, schools, and workplaces in May, a large portion of the country remains closed. The President reduced the salaries of authorities and public officials and Congress was granted permission to operate virtually.
