      As of May 21st, Spain reported their fewest daily COVID-19 deaths at 48. As of May 20th, masks are required where a 2 metre distance is not possible and are being price-controlled and made available in stores. Around May 25th, Spain will move into its next reopening phase where shopping centres, entertainment facilities, and museums will reopen under new health guidelines. The capacity of people permitted in religious places will also increase. In phase two, some regions want to limit the use of beaches and require people to make reservations to use them. By May 25th, all of Spain will be in phase one and almost half of Spain will enter phase two. Without support from the opposition, the Spanish government wants to extend their state of alarm until June 7th. Protests against the prime minister continue in Madrid.
