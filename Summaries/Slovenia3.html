      Across Slovenia, most lockdown measures have been relaxed. Effective June 1, all hotels, fitness clubs and swimming pools reopened. Public gatherings of up to 200 people will also be permitted. The government ended the mandatory use of face coverings in public, but recommends their use in spaces where social distancing is not possible. On June 3, all primary school students will return to classes under strict hygiene guidelines and social distancing measures. A student tested positive, marking the first case among children after returning to school on May 18. The student’s classmates and teachers are in a two-week quarantine, but the remaining students at the school will continue attending classes. 1,000 police officers have been dispatched to Slovenia’s border with Croatia in efforts to tighten border controls and deter migrants and smugglers. The Health Minister told reporters that conditions at care homes need to be improved and additional health facilities need to be set up to properly provide for patients in the event of a second wave.
