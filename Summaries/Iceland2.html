      After most remaining lockdown restrictions were lifted on May 25, social distancing regulations have become optional rather than enforced. Absentee voting in Iceland’s presidential election is now underway, with citizens allowed to vote in-person over the next month at a number of different polling locations. Voting is being conducted in geographic stages, with those in the capital region going first, followed by more rural areas. The Minister of Health has said that the government will announce next week whether they will be able to proceed with the country’s planned opening of borders on June 15. This statement comes after questions have been raised about the government’s airport testing plan, as testing capacity and staffing levels remain low and the cost per test (which the government is planning to cover) remains high. Some revisions to the plan may be made, including shifting the cost of testing to tourists and recruiting private companies to help with testing capacity.
