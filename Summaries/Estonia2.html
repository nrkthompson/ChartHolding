      The Minister of Education has said that the next academic year may start on August 15 - rather than September 1 - in an attempt to fill the gaps that may have arisen during remote learning. The government has discussed barring international students from registering in Estonian universities for the next year in an attempt to insulate from potential spread of the virus. However, universities have warned that this measure would cause them to lose millions of Euros in revenue. At least 10 Finns who crossed the border into Estonia on business in the past few weeks have since been diagnosed with COVID-19, prompting criticism from members of the government’s own Scientific Council that the country has allowed quarantine-free business travel between the two countries.
