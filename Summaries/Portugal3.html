      As of June 1, Portugal entered the third phase of its reopening strategy with several restrictions being lifted in most areas of the country with the exception of Lisbon, where different rules have been implemented regarding large gatherings. The civic self isolation rule  is no longer established, with meetings of up to 20 people allowed in all areas except the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon where the limit is only up to 10. Celebrations are permitted to be held with gatherings of 20 people allowed, followed by the guidelines determined by the Directorate-General for Health, namely within the capacity of religious ceremonies, family events (including weddings and baptisms, whether for civil or religious or other commemorative events) and corporate events held in spaces suitable for this purpose. The rule of mandatory teleworking is eliminated; however, daily and weekly shifts, with ‘mirrored’ teams are suggested to be adopted by the government. Stores located in shopping centres with an area greater than 400 m2 reopened with social distancing rules, except in the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon. Under respected guidelines defined by the Directorate-General for Health, most contact services also resumed operations, including casinos and tattoo services. Restaurants and food courts reopened in all areas except Lisbon, with unlimited capacity but with the maintenance of 1.5m distance between tables and separation barriers installed between the customers seated face to face. Outdoor cultural events, along with theatres, cinemas and auditoriums reopened with the occupation of all rows, mandatory application of masks  and space reserved between the spectators and the audience. The  infrastructures for the practice of individual sports also reopened along with gyms and  indoor/outdoor pools with proposed measures in place.Effective June 4, Portugal’s national airline, TAP Air Portugal, is scheduled to resume nonstop flights between Lisbon and Newark airport, following the completion of the country’s three-phase reopening strategy, with the formal  allowance of  E.U. nationals, except Spain and Italy, to enter via air on June 6.
