      Australia has seen limited growth in daily cases - under 20 on average for the past few weeks, with its Northern Territory declaring itself COVID-free after its last confirmed patient recovered. Meanwhile, people are still being urged to stay vigilant by practising physical distancing and good hygiene, and using contact tracing apps. The National Cabinet has approved the staged reopening of elective surgeries starting at 50% capacity. Australia’s states are proceeding with their own respective reopening plans at different paces - but cafes and restaurants have resumed conditional operation in most states. The reopening of shops is still in progress. The number of people attending gatherings has been capped at 10. Most states are expected to further ease their restrictive measures in the coming two weeks.
