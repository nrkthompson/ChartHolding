      In the past week, Lithuania’s government has continued easing restrictions related to COVID-19. All kindergartens, daycares, and preschools were reopened on May 18, while primary schools will be allowed to reopen on the 25 of May. Post-secondary institutions will also be allowed to hold in-person classes by May 25 if they are unable to do so remotely, while secondary schools will be allowed to reopen on May 30. Public outdoor events with up to 30 participants have been allowed since May 18, provided that organizers are able to maintain at least 2 metres of distance between each individual. Effective May 30, indoor and outdoor high-performance athletic competitions will be allowed to take place without the presence of spectators, while private celebrations will be allowed to take place in public venues with up to 30 guests. Most international flights to and from Lithuania remain grounded, with the exception of flights between Vilnius, Frankfurt (Germany), and Riga (Latvia), which have been allowed since May 13and May 18 respectively. Regular flights between Vilnius, Oslo (Norway), and Tallinn (Estonia) will be allowed to resume by May 25. All Lithuanian residents above the age of 6 are still required to cover their face and nose in public places and adhere to physical distancing guidelines.
