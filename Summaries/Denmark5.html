      A few days after the initial opening of its border to tourists from Norway, Iceland and Germany, Denmark announced that it will open its border to tourists from most European countries on June 27. Eligibility is granted if a country has fewer than 20 cases per 100,000 people over the preceding week. If a country’s infection rate rises to 30 cases per 100,000 people, then tourists will need to quarantine on arrival. Tourists need to show that they have booked accommodation for at least six nights before entering the country. Nordic countries will be assessed on a regional basis, which means residents of certain Swedish regions will be able to enter Denmark even as the country’s infection rate as a whole remains high. Border restrictions with all other countries are currently set to expire on August 31. A town with a large elderly population reported 34 new cases over last weekend in the country’s first major outbreak since the gradual lifting of restrictions began in May. The outbreak is linked to a single long-term care home, but has since spread to two different schools in the town. The Minister of Health said that the outbreak should be taken as a warning to Danes who feel that Denmark is now insulated from the virus.
