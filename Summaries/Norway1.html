      The Norwegian government has said that it is likely to keep travel restrictions in place until at least August 20th, but is willing to consider opening its borders to Nordic countries by June 15th and the rest of Europe by July 20th. Foreign seasonal workers in essential industries have been permitted to enter, but they must submit to a 10-day quarantine upon arrival. Prime Minister Solberg has said that although these restrictions may be lifted, those attempting to enter Norway without a business reason will likely be sent away for the foreseeable future. Despite a low level of infection across the country, the state epidemiologist has said that he does not think that Norway will fall victim to a large second wave of the virus, as the lockdown measures they implemented in March were highly effective. However, the Chief of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has said she believes the virus could have been controlled without the strict lockdown measures that were put in place.
