      Latvia’s nationwide state of emergency will remain in effect until at least June 9, but some of its stricter measures are gradually being relaxed. Gatherings of up to 25 people have been allowed since May 7, provided that individuals are able to maintain at least 2 metres of distance between each other. As of May 18, final exams and on-site consultations are being permitted for secondary school students in their final year of study, while post-secondary schools are being allowed to organize receptions for graduation diplomas on-site with up to 25 people and no guests. Some cultural institutions, such as museums, art galleries, and concert halls, have also been allowed to reopen according to a “sanitary protocol” administered by the Latvian Ministry of Health. Religious services are being allowed to take place subject to sanitary protocols, while weddings, baptisms, and funerals can now be organized with up to 25 guests. All stores and shopping centres are allowed to operate on weekends and holidays, while bars, restaurants, and cafes are being allowed to accept customers indoors with up to two patrons per table.
