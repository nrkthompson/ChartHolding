      The Hungarian government has continued easing restrictions related to COVID-19, focusing on facilitating movement between Hungary and other EU+ countries demonstrating favourable epidemiological situations. Since June 5, Austrian, Slovak, and Czech citizens, as well as Hungarians residing in any of these countries, have been allowed to enter Hungary without a mandatory quarantine period.112 All border crossings between Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia were reopened on June 9, permitting citizens from these countries to travel across each respective border without restrictions.113 Visitation for inpatients residing in social institutions and long-term care homes could resume as of June 3, while hospital visits could resume as of June 13, provided that both the visitor and the inpatient are wearing masks and maintain a two metre distance minimum.114 On June 15, all healthcare services could resume without restrictions.115 This means that 80% of the hospital beds previously reserved for COVID-19 patients can now be used for other purposes.116
