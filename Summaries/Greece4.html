      The Greek Health Ministry has announced 97 new cases since June 5, during which they experienced the largest daily increase since April 23, with 52 new cases in 24 hours.81 In response, on June 9 the government announced they would increase testing and ensure compliance with protection measures as well as introduce restrictions locally where clusters of new infections have been reported over the past few days.82 Of the 97 new cases, 30 involved travellers from abroad. June 15 marks the beginning of the tourist season with flights to the Athens and Thessaloniki airports set to resume. Arrivals from EASA airports will be subject to testing and quarantine. On July 1, flights to all Greek airports and sea arrivals from all countries will resume. Tourists will be subject to random testing. Regardless of Greece's plan to maintain strict hygiene protocols in hotels and businesses, it is uncertain how many airlines will be flying to the country or if people are willing to partake in non-essential travel. 83
