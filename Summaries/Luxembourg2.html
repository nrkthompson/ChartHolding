      On May 25th, 50% of Luxembourg's primary school reopened after being closed for 10 weeks and relying on remote learning, with the other half returning on May 27th. Classes were split into smaller groups with attendance required on a weekly rotational shift. Placement of school desks by 2 metre apart and scheduling of breaks at different times were required by higher levels, whereas restriction of movement and application of masks were deemed unnecessary within classrooms for  kindergarten kids. Cafes and restaurants also reopened on May 27th,  with a maximum of 4 people allowed at a single table outdoors , with indoor dining set to resume by May 29th. Both eateries are ordered to close  by midnight and assure a 1.5 metre distance is present within the groups. In order to provide a boost to the sector, the government also pledged to give every citizen over 16, along with some 200,000 cross border workers from Belgium, France, and Germany, a voucher worth 50 euros to spend in hotels. Civil and religious ceremonies can also resume, under strict conditions such as the application of masks by all attendees along with the maintenance of the 2 metre distance rule. A maximum of 20 people are allowed to attend these events while only 6 are permitted at a home. On May 29th, cinema, theatres, gyms, and sport venues are scheduled to reopen. Swimming pools can only reopen if they provide a valid reopening plan that guarantees the respect of the health and safety measures in place. The  first regular passenger flights  will take place on May 29th,  with Luxair flying to Stockholm, Lisbon, Porto, Hamburg, and Munich.
