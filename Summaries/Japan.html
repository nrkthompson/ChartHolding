  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has experienced a steady increase in new infections since the end of June. Tokyo has reported more than 100 new cases per day for 4 consecutive days starting July 2, with residents asked to be careful and refrain from travelling to other prefectures. Despite the worrisome resurgence, the government is not considering reintroducing a state of emergency. More efficient testing equipment has been approved to supplement the existing testing regime. The supply of masks has doubled in Japan since February, due to a combination of resumed imports and increased domestic production. Antibody testing was conducted in three prefectures at the beginning of June and the results suggested that the actual infection rate of the sample was lower than 0.2%. Most businesses and services have resumed under physical distancing and hygiene rules. Japan and Vietnam have reached an agreement to mutually ease entry restrictions in stages. The first border crossings between the two countries were permitted on June 25.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has been seeing a relatively stable level of new infections for the past week, fluctuating around 50 new cases per day. On June 18, the Japanese prime minister suggested that in order to enhance screening capabilities and structures, alternative methods like saliva-based PCR screening should be introduced and a new PCR center should be established for overseas travellers. Released on June 19, the contact tracing app which alerts users of close contact with confirmed cases, has encountered a glitch that could cause erroneous documentation.  Its notification function has been halted for ongoing repair. Life is almost back to normal since most restrictions have been lifted. Domestic travel was fully restored last weekend and mobile phone location data showed that more people were travelling between Tokyo and other prefectures than the week before last. The opening of the Tokyo International Cruise Terminal, originally scheduled on July 14, has been postponed to September at the earliest as cruise ship operations remain suspended worldwide. Japan’s discussions about easing entry restrictions are ongoing with Vietnam, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand, but Japan’s borders will not reopen to other countries very soon.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Having managed to maintain a limited level of new infections for two weeks, Japan saw more than 70 new infections per day on June 15 and 16. Tokyo continues to be the hotspot of new infections, with nightlife establishments being the most worrisome venues. A contact tracing app is planned to roll out next week. Effective June 12, amusement parks, game centers and internet cafes are allowed to reopen in Tokyo. Bars and restaurants can extend their operation hours from 10 pm to midnight. However, nightlife establishments have been required to enforce preventive guidelines such as physical distancing, installing acrylic boards and wearing masks. Keeping a customer record is also suggested. Starting June 19, restrictive measures will further relax nationwide. National restrictions on the operation of bars, Karaoke boxes, gyms and other businesses will be lifted. Events can accommodate a maximum of 1,000 people while indoor events must simultaneously comply with the 50% capacity limit. Professional sports could resume without spectators. Inter-prefectural travel will be completely restored. Japan is in the final stage of negotiating entry restrictions with Vietnam, while also holding consultations with Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. The limited easing, expected to take effect as early as late June, will first be accessible to Japanese businesspeople.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although there are emerging sporadic outbreaks, Japan has seen an overall low level of new infections over the past weeks. Tokyo continues to be the hotbed of new cases. While saliva-based tests were approved on June 2, targeted testing will replace blanket tests in the future. Reopening progresses nationwide. Most businesses and services have already reopened with rules of physical distancing and hygiene. Professional sports must wait until June 19 to resume. Japan is now considering reopening its borders to business travellers from countries with low levels of infections and strong economic ties such as Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are Trans-Pacific Partnership members.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New outbreaks were documented almost immediately after Japan fully lifted their nationwide state of emergency. The most notable outbreak was in Fukuoka, a southwest Japanese city which, after 23 days of no new cases, has reported more than 40 infections. Antibody tests were randomly given to people aged 20 or older in Tokyo on June 1, with a goal of testing around 10,000 people by the end of June. A contact-tracing app is being developed that exchanges Bluetooth signals between users within a certain distance of each other and notifies them of their exposure to people who have tested COVID+. The government reveals no intention to reintroduce a state of emergency; businesses remain fully reopened and as of June 1 in-person classes resumed in most of the 47 prefectures. Some restrictions remain in place in Tokyo and other prefectures with regards to high-risk facilities like music venues and gyms. As of June 1, travel between prefectures is permitted with discretion. Many amusement parks are reopening across the country. Professional sports are returning with no spectators in the stadiums on June 19. Events can now be held with 100 people indoors if this does not exceed a 50% capacity and can be expanded to include up to 200 people in outdoor venues. Japan is now considering reopening its borders to business travellers from countries with low levels of infections and strong economic ties, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are Trans-Pacific Partnership members.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While prefectural authorities continue to make their own decisions over reopening, Japan’s national government ended its nationwide state of emergency on May 25 - thus lifting many of the most restrictive measures introduced in response to COVID-19. Cultural events such as concerts and exhibitions are being allowed to take place with a limited number of attendees, while karaoke parlors and gyms will reopen on June 1 with strict hygienic guidelines in place. Live music venues and nightlife establishments are being asked to remain closed. Professional sporting events will be allowed to  take place without spectators from June 19, while fans are expected to be welcomed back in July. Students are physically returning to school at a staggered pace. Regular bullet train services have been scheduled to resume from as early as June 1with limited capacity. Border control measures - such as visa restrictions - have been extended to the end of June. 111 countries and regions are currently banned from entering Japan. Restrictions will continue to be eased over 3 week intervals, subject to the country’s ongoing epidemiological situation.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan’s government ended its state of emergency in another 3 regions on May 21, leaving only 5 areas - including Tokyo - under “Specific Cautions”. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on May 14, “a full-fledged start towards a new normal for everyday lives,” providing sanitary guidelines for over 80 industries - including hospitality, commerce, and public transportation.Apart from the areas still under Specific Cautions where people are asked to refrain from leaving home, businesses are requested to close, and events are not to be held, the local authorities can determine the progress of reopening without compulsory restrictions imposed by the national government.Despite the national government's requests, businesses are permitted to reopen, and large-scale events with up to 100 people indoors, and 200 outdoors, are being allowed.</p>
