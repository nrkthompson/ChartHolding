  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan reported about 2.8 new cases of COVID-19 per ten thousand people last week. The health ministry is planning to set up a follow-up center to check with people who have arrived from countries where new strains of the virus are spreading. Japan’s cabinet approved a set of draft bills related to COVID-19, granting more authority to governments at lower levels -- including imposing penalties for businesses and individuals not complying with the restrictions. Local governments have been busy taking different measures to support people self-isolating at home after testing positive, the number of which has topped 35,000 recently. Railway operators in greater Tokyo are now stopping their services earlier in response to the state of emergency. The government has signed a contract with Pfizer to receive vaccines for 72 million people this year. Moderna joined Pfizer and AstraZeneca last week in launching clinical trials of their COVID-19 vaccines in Japan. Japan has not publicized its vaccine rollout plan yet.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan reported no less than 5,000 new cases of COVID-19 per day since the start of January. As of January 17, almost 1,000 COVID-19 patients in the country are in serious condition. The country’s health ministry has decided to expand antigen testing to asymptomatic people at medical institutions and care homes to help identify virus carriers early. The ministry is also working to link quarantine registration and the national epidemiological information system to enable more effective tracking of foreign nationals who test positive for COVID-19. Seven more prefectures joined Tokyo and its three neighboring prefectures last week in the state of emergency. Under the state of emergency, which will be effective until February 7, eating and drinking establishments are asked to close by 8 pm; businesses are asked to help reduce commuting by 70%; and people are urged to refrain from nonessential outings, especially after 8 pm. Starting January 14, the government suspended entry for foreigners -- although those with residence status will be allowed to enter. Japanese nationals and foreigners with resident status are required to self-isolate for 14 days. Negative COVID-19 test results certified within 72 hours of departure have been required since January 13.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases has stayed around 2,900 in Japan since late last week. As of December 15, seven prefectures have been at the highest-level alert for their healthcare system, indicating a serious disruption of regular medical services caused by COVID-19. The Tokyo metropolitan government has asked hospitals to increase the number of beds allocated for seriously ill COVID-19 patients by 50 to 250. A renovated medical facility designed to exclusively treat COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate symptoms opened in Tokyo on December 16. The metropolitan government has started offering free hotel rooms over the New Year to people who have lost their homes. JapanÕs health ministry has suggested that the screening of the Pfizer vaccine will be fast-tracked. Local governments are ordered to prepare for the vaccination of medical workers, potentially beginning in February 2021. The government will suspend its domestic travel campaign between December 28, 2020 and January 11, 2021. Authorities have urged residents of Tokyo and Nagoya to refrain from travelling.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in Japan was 3,000 late last week. Five prefectures are now facing a severe shortage of hospital beds and have occupancy rates around or higher than 50%. The medical staff in Hokkaido prefecture have been too busy treating patients to upload complete information about confirmed COVID-19 cases since last month. Medical teams from the Self-Defense Forces have started assisting frontline workers at two facilities in the country's north that have been hit with clusters of infections. The government is planning to launch a framework for inter-prefectural cooperation to allow medical staff to help with the worst-affected areas in the country. Officials are also urging local authorities to quickly secure more hospital beds. Despite the rampant spread of COVID-19, the Japanese government has not suspended its domestic tourism campaign. Public health officials in Tokyo are urging residents to only go to restaurants in small groups.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The level of daily new cases in Japan remains high, staying above 2,000 for most of the past week. Hospitals across the country are struggling to balance regular services with the surge in COVID-19 infections. The Osaka prefecture declared a state of medical emergency on December 3. The Tokyo metropolitan government is planning to ask medical institutions to secure additional beds for COVID-19 patients. JapanÕs health ministry is likely to recommend that prefectural governments set criteria for hospitalizing COVID-19 patients to ease the burden on medical facilities. The government is asking people who arrive from overseas to arrange their own vehicles when leaving the airport instead of using public transport. It is also arranging buses to shuttle eligible overseas travellers from the international airports in Haneda and Narita to some hotels in Tokyo. Despite the high level of transmission, the government intends to extend its tourism campaign to the end of June next year. Meanwhile, it is asking people aged 65 or older or anyone with underlying health conditions to avoid travel to and from Tokyo through December 17.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan recorded 2,684 new cases on November 28, its largest daily increase. There are more than 460 patients in intensive care. Due to the overwhelming resurgence, the national government removed two cities -- now considered COVID-19 hotspots -- from its domestic tourism campaign. The government is planning to subsidize public transport operators to introduce new anti-virus measures and cashless payment systems. Starting November 28, and lasting for 20 days, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is asking restaurants, bars and karaoke parlors that serve alcohol to reduce their operating hours. Businesses complying with the recommendation will receive subsidies from the government. Several other prefectural governments have made similar requests. Japan and China resumed both short- and long-term business travel between the two countries on November 30.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new cases in Japan has risen rapidly, staying above 2,000 since the middle of last week. The Tokyo metropolitan government rose to its highest alert level on November 19 for the first time since September. The governor of Tokyo called on residents to use caution when eating in groups as the end of the year approaches. The Tokyo government has asked hospitals to increase the number of beds for COVID-19 patients in serious condition from 150 to 300. A medical facility dedicated to patients with milder symptoms is also being built. The health ministry has been pushing for mandatory testing at long-term care facilities once any residents or staff become symptomatic, especially in prefectures with higher infection rates. The ministry also plans to request that prefectures implement an event-based surveillance system in order to expedite identification of cluster infections at an early stage. The prime minister announced that a campaign to encourage domestic travel would be partially halted after an expert panel advised a government review of the program.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new cases in Japan continues to rise, staying above 1,500 a day since the middle of last week. The country is now Òon the highest alert.Ó In order to cope with the surge in cases, the national government has promised to help conduct large-scale testing and dispatch experts and healthcare personnel across the country. The government advisory panel on COVID-19 has called for tougher measures to curb social and economic activities, especially at places such as bars, nightclubs, communities of foreign residents, and universities. The panel also advised authorities to disclose a country-by-country analysis of test results at airport quarantine stations. Major events held at large venues (can hold more than 10,000 people) can have up to 50% capacity. A bill to make the COVID-19 vaccination free is being considered by Japanese lawmakers. The government has agreed with three foreign pharmaceutical firms to receive a total of 290 million doses of a potential vaccine.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in Japan is now on the rise, topping 1,000 over the past weekend. Multiple regions are reporting increases in new cases, adding to the sense of pressure. The northern prefecture of Hokkaido has decided to raise its alert level from 2 to 3 on a scale of five. From November 7 to 27, bars and nightclubs in the major entertainment district are asked to close at 10 pm, while karaoke shops and restaurants will stop serving alcohol by 10 pm. The transport ministry has approved a measure allowing 10 taxi operators in Tokyo to reject passengers who refuse to wear face masks without proper reasons. Other taxi operators and public transport systems may follow suit. Japan and China have agreed to resume round-trip business travel between the two countries from mid-November, applying to both short-term and long-term trips.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has experienced a slight increase in its number of daily new cases over the past week. Four prefectures, including Tokyo, are seeing pressure on hospital capacity. The government has been testing a movement tracking and high precision camera system which checks mask wearing in large crowds. The national cabinet has endorsed a bill to offer free COVID-19 vaccinations and free medical care for any health problems the vaccines may cause. To encourage people to pay for their own COVID-19 tests, the health minister is considering disclosing their cost and accuracy, and what recipients should do if they test positive. Confirmation documents are no longer required for all foreign nationals with residency status and a valid re-entry permit looking to enter Japan from November 1. A negative test conducted within 72 hours of departure from their country of origin is still needed.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in Japan has remained around 500 over the past week. On October 23, a panel of experts approved a plan to test the efficacy of infection controls at large events. The minister in charge of the COVID-19 response said that he would ask businesses to extend their year-end holiday period so that people can stagger their travel. The Japanese government is considering exempting business travelers who stay for no longer than 72 hours from quarantine requirements. The exemption, which could come into effect as early as November, would apply to travelers from countries and regions that have the pandemic under control. In anticipation of the potential spread of flu, Tokyo government officials estimated that they may need up to 7.5 times the existing COVID-19 testing capacity. Pfizer is planning to start clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of October.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in Japan has continued to fluctuate around 500, with no signs of further improvement. The government of Tokyo is planning to launch a program that secures nursing care and accommodation facilities for uninfected senior citizens if their close family members are infected. With some other jurisdictions relaxing their COVID-19 restrictions, JapanÕs foreign ministry is considering lowering the travel alert so that Japanese residents will no longer be urged to cancel their international travel.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases has been fluctuating around 500 in Japan. The government is planning to exempt Japanese business travelers and foreign nationals with residency status from the 14-day quarantine requirement when they return from overseas. The exemption will be subject to a quota and conditions such as avoiding public transit for two weeks upon their return. A research project is being planned by the foreign ministry to help develop international rules on Òhow to handle infectious disease outbreaks onboard cruise ships.Ó</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has experienced a slight increase in the average level of daily new cases over the past week. The health minister has vowed to double the antigen testing capacity at airports to 20,000 per day as the country eases some border restrictions. The government put forward a vaccination plan on October 2, saying that they would cover all costs associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. Anyone who develops adverse side effects will receive compensation to cover them as well. Despite the resurgence of COVID-19 in many parts of the world, foreigners who have qualified for mid-term or long-term visas, including medical and educational professionals, businesspeople, and students, are permitted to enter Japan after October 1 so long as their sponsor ensures that they comply with a two-week quarantine period upon their arrival. After waiting for months, Tokyo was finally included in the nationwide tourism campaign on October 1, even as it did not experience a significant reduction in its daily new cases.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No clear signals of further improvement to JapanÕs COVID-19 situation have been observed. The prime minister announced on September 25 that the government would aim to have a strengthened testing regime, performing an average of 200,000 tests per day. The tests will be performed at regional medical institutions, as well as a rapid screening process at medical institutions and long-term care facilities in infection-affected areas. JapanÕs information sharing system on COVID-19 is still facing challenges as there is inadequate input from medical institutions. The Japanese government decided on September 25 to gradually ease border restrictions from the beginning of October. The easing of restrictions targets all foreigners from around the world who have been granted mid- or long-term visas, such as businesspeople, medical professionals and privately financed students. Some limits on the easing of restrictions apply. All tourism-related travel to Japan remains banned.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in Japan has stayed around 500 over the past 10 days. The online system for sharing data on COVID-19 infections nationwide is expected to connect to all municipalities in October, although some challenges related to data accuracy are expected. Despite a new Prime Minister coming into office on September 16, Japan’s COVID-19 policy is expected to remain the same as it was under the previous prime minister. Effective September 16, bars and restaurants in Tokyo are permitted to stay open after 10 pm. The national government is planning to ease gathering limits at public events, allowing professional sports to fill their venues to 50% capacity. In the meantime, Tokyo still has to wait to be included in the nationwide tourism campaign. The Japanese government has allowed short-term business trips to and from Singapore, effective September 18. Businesspeople from Singapore will be exempt from a 14-day quarantine period if they meet certain requirements, including submitting their itineraries in advance. Expanded PCR testing capacity is planned at airports.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has seen a downward trend in daily new infections for the past two weeks. However, Typhoon Haishen may have significantly disrupted the situation in the country. The government has reportedly been unable to use the new information-sharing system for COVID-19 data that was introduced in May, as it is “not yet fully developed.” Due to fears about the upcoming flu season coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, health officials are planning to call on elderly people to get a flu vaccination before a possible shortage. The Health Ministry is also boosting virus testing systems before the flu season begins. The Japanese government announced on August 28 that all foreign residents who left Japan before August 31 with a valid re-entry permit were eligible to re-enter Japan from September 1. The government is also easing entry restrictions for long-term residents from Taiwan, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar from September 8. Negotiations are ongoing with other Asian countries.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has reported around 1,000 new infections per day for the past two weeks. The government has separately agreed with the UK pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and Pfizer of the US on a supply of vaccines once they are developed. According to the discussion among ministers and experts, the plan is to prioritize the vaccination of medical workers, the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. The welfare ministry has opened six bases this month to support companies developing robots that can assist in nursing care, as well as 11 consultation centers for operators of nursing-care businesses across the country. The Tokyo Governor is urging residents to take thorough precautions in every aspect of daily life, asking people who live together to not share tableware, towels, or toothpaste. The key western port of Hakata has drawn up a policy that rejects port calls by cruise ships until an effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is ready. Japan entered into an agreement with Cambodia and Laos to allow long-term residents to travel between the countries as early as September. The governments are still working on admitting government-sponsored students and short-term visitors, including businesspeople.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new infections has stayed above 1,000 for most of the past two weeks. A significant portion of cases are linked to community transmission. As the health system faces the risk of being overwhelmed, the Tokyo Governor has called on the central government to provide funding for hospital beds and ventilators and to enhance immigration control to prevent the further spread of the virus ahead of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games scheduled for next year. The National Governors' Association is asking for additional subsidies to businesses to effectively implement closure requests. Legal measures, including penalties, are also being requested in order to put pressure on businesses that reject governors' requests or refuse to cooperate in contact tracing. Facing a growing risk of cyberattacks aimed at stealing information on vaccine development, Japan's health ministry is urging pharmaceutical companies and research institutes to exercise caution. Tokyo residents are still asked to use the most caution in their everyday life. Many festivals for the summer holiday have been curtailed.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new daily infections continues to increase in Japan, which has been above 1,000 for almost two weeks. Despite that, the Prime Minister said that there are sufficient medical resources to handle the continued outbreaks. Meanwhile, an association of prefectural governors is urging people to carefully consider whether to visit their hometowns during the summer holidays and is calling on the central government to step up testing. Government advisors plan to set up a series of indexes, such as hospital bed occupancy rates, to help local authorities gauge the spread of the virus in their regions. The clinical tests of an experimental vaccine jointly developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University will begin this month. As of August 2, the re-entry of foreign nationals with residency status who left Japan before their destination became subject to denial of landing will be permitted to re-enter Japan--conditional on a confirmation letter and a negative result on a COVID-19 test conducted within 72 hours prior to travel. Permanent residents and the spouses or children of a Japanese national or permanent resident will be required to follow this measure effective September 1.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan recorded more than 1,000 new cases per day for five days in a row through to August 2. The daily average of new infections in Tokyo during the week of July 29 was over 250, with around 60% of the cases being untraceable. Experts believe that the virus has spread to all generations by diverse means. The Tokyo Medical Association is considering increasing the number of testing sites in Tokyo to 1,400 from the current 300 or so. The government plans to provide another 80 million washable cloth masks to care facilities nationwide by the end of September, in addition to the 77 million that it has already supplied. The government has decided against easing attendance limits any further at public events; the current cap of 5,000 will remain until the end of August. Restaurants and bars in Tokyo where alcoholic drinks are served, as well as karaoke parlors, are asked to close by 10 pm during the period from August 3 to 31. As compensation, small and medium-sized companies that operate those types of businesses will be offered about $1,900 if they agree to the operating shorter hours. The Tokyo governor also called on residents to refrain from going out and drinking in groups. Japan’s education ministry said that more than 1,700 boards of education planned to shorten summer holidays to make up for cancelled classes. Starting August 5, foreigners with certain residence statuses--such as international students, technical trainees and some company employees--will be allowed to enter Japan on the condition that they comply with requirements such as taking a PCR test. Japan, Vietnam and Thailand have agreed to allow businesspeople to resume visits between the countries. Japan has started accepting long-stay visa applications. Arrivals of Vietnamese and Thai people in Japan are expected in August. To help boost international business travel, the government is working on a reservation system for businesspeople to get tested before they go abroad. This could be set up in late September.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan recorded its highest number of daily new infections on July 23 with more than 920 new cases. Tokyo has continued to record more than 200 new infections a day for the past week, with an increasing number of cases related to community transmission. Japan is planning to expand the PCR testing capacity at airports from the current maximum of 2,300 to 10,000 per day by the end of September to prepare for the easing of travel restrictions. Although a reintroduction of the state of emergency is not expected, some governors are calling for revisions to a special law to make infection prevention measures more enforceable. A decision on whether or not capacity limits at public events can be further relaxed is expected to be made on August 1. The government is set to begin talks with 12 countries and territories, including China and South Korea, on mutually allowing business travel. International students are now allowed to re-enter the country if they meet certain requirements, including testing prior to departure. Relaxed entry for athletes and sports officials coming for the Olympic and Paralympic Games is also being considered.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan is still grappling with an increasing number of daily new infections. Tokyo has been put on the highest possible COVID-19 alert level. Residents and business owners have been urged to follow infection prevention measures, but businesses have still not been asked to close. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government plans to expand the testing system, and offer support to public health centers facing an increased workload. Japan's health ministry expanded testing to asymptomatic people on July 17. It has been suggested that the government create specific testing guidelines for three categories of people and places, based on the risk of infection. Japan’s contact tracing app resumed on July 15 after a second suspension due to notification errors. Japan has asked the U.S. to test all of its military personnel coming to Japan after almost 100 cases have been reported at U.S. bases in Japan. An NHK poll showed that nearly 70 percent of respondents wanted the government to prioritize the fight against COVID-19 over the economy. A domestic travel campaign starting July 22 has been announced, excluding trips to and from Tokyo. More than 10 universities in Tokyo have decided to continue online classes in the fall semester.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan is experiencing an uptick in new infections. Tokyo has recorded more than 200 new cases per day for 4 consecutive days, starting on July 9. The positivity rate of testing in Tokyo has been rising in recent weeks, reaching 5.1% on July 5 after being around 1% at the end of May. The Metropolitan Government decided to secure 3,000 beds for COVID-19 patients on July 9. At the same time, more PCR tests will be conducted in Tokyo and the number of staff at local public health centres will be increased. A new COVID-19 subcommittee met for the first time on Monday to replace the original panel of experts, with the primary focus on reopening the economy. Despite the resurgence of infections, Japan’s reopening strategy will not be interrupted. Almost all businesses have resumed operations. The maximum number of participants at an event was raised from 1,000 to 5,000 on July 10. Attendees are discouraged from visiting facilities without proper health and safety precautions, and will be required to install the contact-tracing app and provide their contact details to organizers. Temperature checks will also be mandatory upon entry. The government is planning to allow foreign nationals with student and technical trainee visas to re-enter the country. Negotiations are underway to let businesspeople from about 10 countries and territories travel to and from Japan.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has experienced a steady increase in new infections since the end of June. Tokyo has reported more than 100 new cases per day for 4 consecutive days starting July 2, with residents asked to be careful and refrain from travelling to other prefectures. Despite the worrisome resurgence, the government is not considering reintroducing a state of emergency. More efficient testing equipment has been approved to supplement the existing testing regime. The supply of masks has doubled in Japan since February, due to a combination of resumed imports and increased domestic production. Antibody testing was conducted in three prefectures at the beginning of June and the results suggested that the actual infection rate of the sample was lower than 0.2%. Most businesses and services have resumed under physical distancing and hygiene rules. Japan and Vietnam have reached an agreement to mutually ease entry restrictions in stages. The first border crossings between the two countries were permitted on June 25.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has been seeing a relatively stable level of new infections for the past week, fluctuating around 50 new cases per day. On June 18, the Japanese prime minister suggested that in order to enhance screening capabilities and structures, alternative methods like saliva-based PCR screening should be introduced and a new PCR center should be established for overseas travellers. Released on June 19, the contact tracing app which alerts users of close contact with confirmed cases, has encountered a glitch that could cause erroneous documentation.  Its notification function has been halted for ongoing repair. Life is almost back to normal since most restrictions have been lifted. Domestic travel was fully restored last weekend and mobile phone location data showed that more people were travelling between Tokyo and other prefectures than the week before last. The opening of the Tokyo International Cruise Terminal, originally scheduled on July 14, has been postponed to September at the earliest as cruise ship operations remain suspended worldwide. Japan’s discussions about easing entry restrictions are ongoing with Vietnam, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand, but Japan’s borders will not reopen to other countries very soon.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Having managed to maintain a limited level of new infections for two weeks, Japan saw more than 70 new infections per day on June 15 and 16. Tokyo continues to be the hotspot of new infections, with nightlife establishments being the most worrisome venues. A contact tracing app is planned to roll out next week. Effective June 12, amusement parks, game centers and internet cafes are allowed to reopen in Tokyo. Bars and restaurants can extend their operation hours from 10 pm to midnight. However, nightlife establishments have been required to enforce preventive guidelines such as physical distancing, installing acrylic boards and wearing masks. Keeping a customer record is also suggested. Starting June 19, restrictive measures will further relax nationwide. National restrictions on the operation of bars, Karaoke boxes, gyms and other businesses will be lifted. Events can accommodate a maximum of 1,000 people while indoor events must simultaneously comply with the 50% capacity limit. Professional sports could resume without spectators. Inter-prefectural travel will be completely restored. Japan is in the final stage of negotiating entry restrictions with Vietnam, while also holding consultations with Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. The limited easing, expected to take effect as early as late June, will first be accessible to Japanese businesspeople.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although there are emerging sporadic outbreaks, Japan has seen an overall low level of new infections over the past weeks. Tokyo continues to be the hotbed of new cases. While saliva-based tests were approved on June 2, targeted testing will replace blanket tests in the future. Reopening progresses nationwide. Most businesses and services have already reopened with rules of physical distancing and hygiene. Professional sports must wait until June 19 to resume. Japan is now considering reopening its borders to business travellers from countries with low levels of infections and strong economic ties such as Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are Trans-Pacific Partnership members.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New outbreaks were documented almost immediately after Japan fully lifted their nationwide state of emergency. The most notable outbreak was in Fukuoka, a southwest Japanese city which, after 23 days of no new cases, has reported more than 40 infections. Antibody tests were randomly given to people aged 20 or older in Tokyo on June 1, with a goal of testing around 10,000 people by the end of June. A contact-tracing app is being developed that exchanges Bluetooth signals between users within a certain distance of each other and notifies them of their exposure to people who have tested COVID+. The government reveals no intention to reintroduce a state of emergency; businesses remain fully reopened and as of June 1 in-person classes resumed in most of the 47 prefectures. Some restrictions remain in place in Tokyo and other prefectures with regards to high-risk facilities like music venues and gyms. As of June 1, travel between prefectures is permitted with discretion. Many amusement parks are reopening across the country. Professional sports are returning with no spectators in the stadiums on June 19. Events can now be held with 100 people indoors if this does not exceed a 50% capacity and can be expanded to include up to 200 people in outdoor venues. Japan is now considering reopening its borders to business travellers from countries with low levels of infections and strong economic ties, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are Trans-Pacific Partnership members.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While prefectural authorities continue to make their own decisions over reopening, Japan’s national government ended its nationwide state of emergency on May 25 - thus lifting many of the most restrictive measures introduced in response to COVID-19. Cultural events such as concerts and exhibitions are being allowed to take place with a limited number of attendees, while karaoke parlors and gyms will reopen on June 1 with strict hygienic guidelines in place. Live music venues and nightlife establishments are being asked to remain closed. Professional sporting events will be allowed to  take place without spectators from June 19, while fans are expected to be welcomed back in July. Students are physically returning to school at a staggered pace. Regular bullet train services have been scheduled to resume from as early as June 1with limited capacity. Border control measures - such as visa restrictions - have been extended to the end of June. 111 countries and regions are currently banned from entering Japan. Restrictions will continue to be eased over 3 week intervals, subject to the country’s ongoing epidemiological situation.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan’s government ended its state of emergency in another 3 regions on May 21, leaving only 5 areas - including Tokyo - under “Specific Cautions”. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on May 14, “a full-fledged start towards a new normal for everyday lives,” providing sanitary guidelines for over 80 industries - including hospitality, commerce, and public transportation.Apart from the areas still under Specific Cautions where people are asked to refrain from leaving home, businesses are requested to close, and events are not to be held, the local authorities can determine the progress of reopening without compulsory restrictions imposed by the national government.Despite the national government's requests, businesses are permitted to reopen, and large-scale events with up to 100 people indoors, and 200 outdoors, are being allowed.</p>
