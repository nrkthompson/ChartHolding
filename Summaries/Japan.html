  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has seen a downward trend in daily new infections for the past two weeks. However, Typhoon Haishen may have significantly disrupted the situation in the country. The government has reportedly been unable to use the new information-sharing system for COVID-19 data that was introduced in May, as it is “not yet fully developed.” Due to fears about the upcoming flu season coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, health officials are planning to call on elderly people to get a flu vaccination before a possible shortage. The Health Ministry is also boosting virus testing systems before the flu season begins. The Japanese government announced on August 28 that all foreign residents who left Japan before August 31 with a valid re-entry permit were eligible to re-enter Japan from September 1. The government is also easing entry restrictions for long-term residents from Taiwan, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar from September 8. Negotiations are ongoing with other Asian countries.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has reported around 1,000 new infections per day for the past two weeks. The government has separately agreed with the UK pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and Pfizer of the US on a supply of vaccines once they are developed. According to the discussion among ministers and experts, the plan is to prioritize the vaccination of medical workers, the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. The welfare ministry has opened six bases this month to support companies developing robots that can assist in nursing care, as well as 11 consultation centers for operators of nursing-care businesses across the country. The Tokyo Governor is urging residents to take thorough precautions in every aspect of daily life, asking people who live together to not share tableware, towels, or toothpaste. The key western port of Hakata has drawn up a policy that rejects port calls by cruise ships until an effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is ready. Japan entered into an agreement with Cambodia and Laos to allow long-term residents to travel between the countries as early as September. The governments are still working on admitting government-sponsored students and short-term visitors, including businesspeople.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new infections has stayed above 1,000 for most of the past two weeks. A significant portion of cases are linked to community transmission. As the health system faces the risk of being overwhelmed, the Tokyo Governor has called on the central government to provide funding for hospital beds and ventilators and to enhance immigration control to prevent the further spread of the virus ahead of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games scheduled for next year. The National Governors' Association is asking for additional subsidies to businesses to effectively implement closure requests. Legal measures, including penalties, are also being requested in order to put pressure on businesses that reject governors' requests or refuse to cooperate in contact tracing. Facing a growing risk of cyberattacks aimed at stealing information on vaccine development, Japan's health ministry is urging pharmaceutical companies and research institutes to exercise caution. Tokyo residents are still asked to use the most caution in their everyday life. Many festivals for the summer holiday have been curtailed.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new daily infections continues to increase in Japan, which has been above 1,000 for almost two weeks. Despite that, the Prime Minister said that there are sufficient medical resources to handle the continued outbreaks. Meanwhile, an association of prefectural governors is urging people to carefully consider whether to visit their hometowns during the summer holidays and is calling on the central government to step up testing. Government advisors plan to set up a series of indexes, such as hospital bed occupancy rates, to help local authorities gauge the spread of the virus in their regions. The clinical tests of an experimental vaccine jointly developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University will begin this month. As of August 2, the re-entry of foreign nationals with residency status who left Japan before their destination became subject to denial of landing will be permitted to re-enter Japan--conditional on a confirmation letter and a negative result on a COVID-19 test conducted within 72 hours prior to travel. Permanent residents and the spouses or children of a Japanese national or permanent resident will be required to follow this measure effective September 1.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan recorded more than 1,000 new cases per day for five days in a row through to August 2. The daily average of new infections in Tokyo during the week of July 29 was over 250, with around 60% of the cases being untraceable. Experts believe that the virus has spread to all generations by diverse means. The Tokyo Medical Association is considering increasing the number of testing sites in Tokyo to 1,400 from the current 300 or so. The government plans to provide another 80 million washable cloth masks to care facilities nationwide by the end of September, in addition to the 77 million that it has already supplied. The government has decided against easing attendance limits any further at public events; the current cap of 5,000 will remain until the end of August. Restaurants and bars in Tokyo where alcoholic drinks are served, as well as karaoke parlors, are asked to close by 10 pm during the period from August 3 to 31. As compensation, small and medium-sized companies that operate those types of businesses will be offered about $1,900 if they agree to the operating shorter hours. The Tokyo governor also called on residents to refrain from going out and drinking in groups. Japan’s education ministry said that more than 1,700 boards of education planned to shorten summer holidays to make up for cancelled classes. Starting August 5, foreigners with certain residence statuses--such as international students, technical trainees and some company employees--will be allowed to enter Japan on the condition that they comply with requirements such as taking a PCR test. Japan, Vietnam and Thailand have agreed to allow businesspeople to resume visits between the countries. Japan has started accepting long-stay visa applications. Arrivals of Vietnamese and Thai people in Japan are expected in August. To help boost international business travel, the government is working on a reservation system for businesspeople to get tested before they go abroad. This could be set up in late September.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan recorded its highest number of daily new infections on July 23 with more than 920 new cases. Tokyo has continued to record more than 200 new infections a day for the past week, with an increasing number of cases related to community transmission. Japan is planning to expand the PCR testing capacity at airports from the current maximum of 2,300 to 10,000 per day by the end of September to prepare for the easing of travel restrictions. Although a reintroduction of the state of emergency is not expected, some governors are calling for revisions to a special law to make infection prevention measures more enforceable. A decision on whether or not capacity limits at public events can be further relaxed is expected to be made on August 1. The government is set to begin talks with 12 countries and territories, including China and South Korea, on mutually allowing business travel. International students are now allowed to re-enter the country if they meet certain requirements, including testing prior to departure. Relaxed entry for athletes and sports officials coming for the Olympic and Paralympic Games is also being considered.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan is still grappling with an increasing number of daily new infections. Tokyo has been put on the highest possible COVID-19 alert level. Residents and business owners have been urged to follow infection prevention measures, but businesses have still not been asked to close. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government plans to expand the testing system, and offer support to public health centers facing an increased workload. Japan's health ministry expanded testing to asymptomatic people on July 17. It has been suggested that the government create specific testing guidelines for three categories of people and places, based on the risk of infection. Japan’s contact tracing app resumed on July 15 after a second suspension due to notification errors. Japan has asked the U.S. to test all of its military personnel coming to Japan after almost 100 cases have been reported at U.S. bases in Japan. An NHK poll showed that nearly 70 percent of respondents wanted the government to prioritize the fight against COVID-19 over the economy. A domestic travel campaign starting July 22 has been announced, excluding trips to and from Tokyo. More than 10 universities in Tokyo have decided to continue online classes in the fall semester.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan is experiencing an uptick in new infections. Tokyo has recorded more than 200 new cases per day for 4 consecutive days, starting on July 9. The positivity rate of testing in Tokyo has been rising in recent weeks, reaching 5.1% on July 5 after being around 1% at the end of May. The Metropolitan Government decided to secure 3,000 beds for COVID-19 patients on July 9. At the same time, more PCR tests will be conducted in Tokyo and the number of staff at local public health centres will be increased. A new COVID-19 subcommittee met for the first time on Monday to replace the original panel of experts, with the primary focus on reopening the economy. Despite the resurgence of infections, Japan’s reopening strategy will not be interrupted. Almost all businesses have resumed operations. The maximum number of participants at an event was raised from 1,000 to 5,000 on July 10. Attendees are discouraged from visiting facilities without proper health and safety precautions, and will be required to install the contact-tracing app and provide their contact details to organizers. Temperature checks will also be mandatory upon entry. The government is planning to allow foreign nationals with student and technical trainee visas to re-enter the country. Negotiations are underway to let businesspeople from about 10 countries and territories travel to and from Japan.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has experienced a steady increase in new infections since the end of June. Tokyo has reported more than 100 new cases per day for 4 consecutive days starting July 2, with residents asked to be careful and refrain from travelling to other prefectures. Despite the worrisome resurgence, the government is not considering reintroducing a state of emergency. More efficient testing equipment has been approved to supplement the existing testing regime. The supply of masks has doubled in Japan since February, due to a combination of resumed imports and increased domestic production. Antibody testing was conducted in three prefectures at the beginning of June and the results suggested that the actual infection rate of the sample was lower than 0.2%. Most businesses and services have resumed under physical distancing and hygiene rules. Japan and Vietnam have reached an agreement to mutually ease entry restrictions in stages. The first border crossings between the two countries were permitted on June 25.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan has been seeing a relatively stable level of new infections for the past week, fluctuating around 50 new cases per day. On June 18, the Japanese prime minister suggested that in order to enhance screening capabilities and structures, alternative methods like saliva-based PCR screening should be introduced and a new PCR center should be established for overseas travellers. Released on June 19, the contact tracing app which alerts users of close contact with confirmed cases, has encountered a glitch that could cause erroneous documentation.  Its notification function has been halted for ongoing repair. Life is almost back to normal since most restrictions have been lifted. Domestic travel was fully restored last weekend and mobile phone location data showed that more people were travelling between Tokyo and other prefectures than the week before last. The opening of the Tokyo International Cruise Terminal, originally scheduled on July 14, has been postponed to September at the earliest as cruise ship operations remain suspended worldwide. Japan’s discussions about easing entry restrictions are ongoing with Vietnam, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand, but Japan’s borders will not reopen to other countries very soon.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Having managed to maintain a limited level of new infections for two weeks, Japan saw more than 70 new infections per day on June 15 and 16. Tokyo continues to be the hotspot of new infections, with nightlife establishments being the most worrisome venues. A contact tracing app is planned to roll out next week. Effective June 12, amusement parks, game centers and internet cafes are allowed to reopen in Tokyo. Bars and restaurants can extend their operation hours from 10 pm to midnight. However, nightlife establishments have been required to enforce preventive guidelines such as physical distancing, installing acrylic boards and wearing masks. Keeping a customer record is also suggested. Starting June 19, restrictive measures will further relax nationwide. National restrictions on the operation of bars, Karaoke boxes, gyms and other businesses will be lifted. Events can accommodate a maximum of 1,000 people while indoor events must simultaneously comply with the 50% capacity limit. Professional sports could resume without spectators. Inter-prefectural travel will be completely restored. Japan is in the final stage of negotiating entry restrictions with Vietnam, while also holding consultations with Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. The limited easing, expected to take effect as early as late June, will first be accessible to Japanese businesspeople.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although there are emerging sporadic outbreaks, Japan has seen an overall low level of new infections over the past weeks. Tokyo continues to be the hotbed of new cases. While saliva-based tests were approved on June 2, targeted testing will replace blanket tests in the future. Reopening progresses nationwide. Most businesses and services have already reopened with rules of physical distancing and hygiene. Professional sports must wait until June 19 to resume. Japan is now considering reopening its borders to business travellers from countries with low levels of infections and strong economic ties such as Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are Trans-Pacific Partnership members.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New outbreaks were documented almost immediately after Japan fully lifted their nationwide state of emergency. The most notable outbreak was in Fukuoka, a southwest Japanese city which, after 23 days of no new cases, has reported more than 40 infections. Antibody tests were randomly given to people aged 20 or older in Tokyo on June 1, with a goal of testing around 10,000 people by the end of June. A contact-tracing app is being developed that exchanges Bluetooth signals between users within a certain distance of each other and notifies them of their exposure to people who have tested COVID+. The government reveals no intention to reintroduce a state of emergency; businesses remain fully reopened and as of June 1 in-person classes resumed in most of the 47 prefectures. Some restrictions remain in place in Tokyo and other prefectures with regards to high-risk facilities like music venues and gyms. As of June 1, travel between prefectures is permitted with discretion. Many amusement parks are reopening across the country. Professional sports are returning with no spectators in the stadiums on June 19. Events can now be held with 100 people indoors if this does not exceed a 50% capacity and can be expanded to include up to 200 people in outdoor venues. Japan is now considering reopening its borders to business travellers from countries with low levels of infections and strong economic ties, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are Trans-Pacific Partnership members.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While prefectural authorities continue to make their own decisions over reopening, Japan’s national government ended its nationwide state of emergency on May 25 - thus lifting many of the most restrictive measures introduced in response to COVID-19. Cultural events such as concerts and exhibitions are being allowed to take place with a limited number of attendees, while karaoke parlors and gyms will reopen on June 1 with strict hygienic guidelines in place. Live music venues and nightlife establishments are being asked to remain closed. Professional sporting events will be allowed to  take place without spectators from June 19, while fans are expected to be welcomed back in July. Students are physically returning to school at a staggered pace. Regular bullet train services have been scheduled to resume from as early as June 1with limited capacity. Border control measures - such as visa restrictions - have been extended to the end of June. 111 countries and regions are currently banned from entering Japan. Restrictions will continue to be eased over 3 week intervals, subject to the country’s ongoing epidemiological situation.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Japan’s government ended its state of emergency in another 3 regions on May 21, leaving only 5 areas - including Tokyo - under “Specific Cautions”. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on May 14, “a full-fledged start towards a new normal for everyday lives,” providing sanitary guidelines for over 80 industries - including hospitality, commerce, and public transportation.Apart from the areas still under Specific Cautions where people are asked to refrain from leaving home, businesses are requested to close, and events are not to be held, the local authorities can determine the progress of reopening without compulsory restrictions imposed by the national government.Despite the national government's requests, businesses are permitted to reopen, and large-scale events with up to 100 people indoors, and 200 outdoors, are being allowed.</p>
