      As some European countries have offered tourists the chance to be tested at the airport upon their arrival to avoid a two week quarantine, Finland has indicated that it will not do the same. Finnish authorities have said that they concur with the European Centre for Disease Control that airport tests can often be ineffective, and the low number of positive cases that will result from this program are not worth the high costs. Public health officials in Finland have continued to advise against domestic leisure travel for the time being, even as most lockdown restrictions will be lifted over the next few weeks. The Constitutional Committee of Finland has said that the country’s restaurant restrictions need to be revised before their scheduled opening on June 1st, with the restrictions being in place for too long and that they should be imposed regionally, not across the board. The government has doubled the number of foreign agricultural workers that will be allowed into the country this summer (from 4500 to 9000) after many large farms stated that they would not be able to complete their harvest in time with such a small number.
