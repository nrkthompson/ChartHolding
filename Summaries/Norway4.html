      Health authorities in Norway are concerned that an anti-racism protest in Oslo that drew nearly 15,000 people could lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases. Contrary to a protest the week before in Sweden, where police in Oslo allowed the protest to go ahead despite clear violations of gathering limits and social distancing regulations. The government is encouraging all those who attended the protest to get tested for the virus if they show any symptoms within the next few days. These concerns come as Oslo has seen its number of new COVID-19 cases triple in the last week. Public health officials downplayed the seriousness of the rise in cases as the total infection rate in the country remains very low. The Public Health Agency is recommending that testing guidelines be changed to allow those with extremely mild symptoms to access testing. Additionally, public health officials said that their current testing capacity of 100,000 is nowhere close to being reached, and could even be increased relatively easily if given the resources.
