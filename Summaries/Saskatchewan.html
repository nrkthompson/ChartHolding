  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The provincial government announced that the 50% capacity restriction on restaurants will be lifted on July 6, but physical distancing must be maintained. Health officials and business owners expressed confidence in the cancellation of the capacity limit. Indoor athletic and performing arts activities may also resume on July 6, while racetracks and rodeo-related activities can resume on July 16. Contact sports like hockey and football were permitted on June 29, but travelling for competitions and the number of participants at each game must be limited. Visits to long-term care facilities will be expanded on July 7, allowing more people to serve as support persons for critical and end-of-life care. A heated debate between the opposition NDP and the governing Saskatchewan Party broke out during Question Period on July 2, after the opposition criticized the government for reducing the province’s inventory of a variety of health supplies in 2014. The health minister responded by saying that it sounded like the NDP were disappointed that the pandemic did not hit Saskatchewan harder than it has.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The second part of Phase 4 of the province’s reopening plan will commence on June 29, with cultural institutions allowed to reopen. Cinemas and live theatres can reopen at 30% capacity (or a maximum of 150 people), while visitors to museums and libraries must be able to maintain social distance. Outdoor sports games and activities are allowed to resume, though social distancing should be maintained if possible. Parks and campgrounds may open at full capacity for overnight stays and limited term campsites. All workers at personal care services, fitness centres and restaurants must wear a mask when social distancing cannot be maintained. The reopening of indoor pools, indoor sports and other entertainment venues will be announced within the next two weeks. The province’s Chief Medical Health Officer has said that discussions are underway to lift the government’s recommendation against non-essential interprovincial travel. While the provincial government advises Saskatchewan residents to avoid going to other provinces, it does not enforce an isolation period upon their return.</p>
