  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The second part of Phase 4 of the province’s reopening plan will commence on June 29, with cultural institutions allowed to reopen. Cinemas and live theatres can reopen at 30% capacity (or a maximum of 150 people), while visitors to museums and libraries must be able to maintain social distance. Outdoor sports games and activities are allowed to resume, though social distancing should be maintained if possible. Parks and campgrounds may open at full capacity for overnight stays and limited term campsites. All workers at personal care services, fitness centres and restaurants must wear a mask when social distancing cannot be maintained. The reopening of indoor pools, indoor sports and other entertainment venues will be announced within the next two weeks. The province’s Chief Medical Health Officer has said that discussions are underway to lift the government’s recommendation against non-essential interprovincial travel. While the provincial government advises Saskatchewan residents to avoid going to other provinces, it does not enforce an isolation period upon their return.</p>
