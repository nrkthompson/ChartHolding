  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Saskatchewan reported 82 new cases of COVID-19 on October 29 in the province’s largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. As of November 1, there are 798 active cases in the province, with 33 hospitalizations. Most cases are concentrated in the Saskatoon area. As a result, the provincial government announced that nightclubs in Saskatoon must stop the sale of alcohol by 10 pm, and must close by 11 pm. Customer registration is recommended for all bars and restaurants in the province. The new public health order has caused some confusion over the definition of a nightclub, as bars are not affected by the restrictions. The Saskatchewan Party won a resounding victory in the provincial election on October 26, giving them their fourth consecutive majority government. Voters had largely approved of their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Saskatchewan reported 78 new cases of COVID-19 on October 24 in the province’s largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. As of October 25, there are 619 active cases and 25 hospitalizations, also a record-high. At least 86 cases have been linked to the Prince Albert religious gathering that caused the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation (PBCN) to enter a lockdown. More than 450 people may have been exposed to COVID-19 due to the gathering. Elections Saskatchewan will deliver voting kits to those on the PBCN who will be unable to reach a polling station on October 26. An outbreak on the Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation has also been declared, with authorities warning residents to wear a mask if they must leave their homes. Officials do not expect to know the complete results of the provincial election on October 26 due to the large volume of absentee ballots they have received.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After 36 new cases were reported in Saskatchewan on October 18, the number of active cases in the province reached a record-high of 342. 79 of the cases are connected to the outbreak at a religious gathering in Prince Albert, with more associated cases still expected. As a result of the rising number of cases, the provincial government lowered the private gathering limit to 15 people and the public gathering limit to 30 people. The limit does not apply to restaurants, bars, banquet halls, weddings, funerals, or religious gatherings due to other requirements for those establishments. Elections Saskatchewan said mask-wearing will be strongly recommended for all those voting in-person, but will not be mandatory, keeping with provincial guidelines. The Sask. Junior Hockey League announced that up to 150 spectators will be permitted when they return to play next week, provided they comply with mask and social distancing requirements.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Saskatchewan reported 48 new cases of COVID-19 on October 12 in the province’s largest daily increase since late July. A significant proportion of the new cases are connected to a religious gathering in Prince Albert. Due to the outbreak associated with the gathering, Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation has implemented a lockdown. Only band members and residents will be permitted entry, and all incoming cars will be searched. Residents will be allowed to leave for food or for medical appointments on specific days. No gatherings will be permitted, and all schools will close until at least October 19. Due to the rising number of cases, the leader of the provincial NDP called for the government to clarify COVID-19 guidelines and the thresholds used to implement restrictions. The premier said that the NDP was politicizing the pandemic and undermining confidence in public health officials in advance of the provincial election on October 26.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, Saskatchewan’s chief medical health officer issued a reminder that private gatherings should be limited to 30 people, and that social distancing must be maintained, recommending that private gatherings only include members of your household or extended household. A number of outbreaks have been reported in the Yorkton area, although extensive local restrictions are not expected to be implemented. The Saskatchewan Health Authority said that outside visitors to the hospital and long-term care facility in the town will be severely limited. Saskatchewan’s election campaign is underway in advance of the provincial election on October 26. Elections Saskatchewan said they are able to receive up to 40% of total vote through mail-in ballots, though only around 10% of voters are expected to exercise that right.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There are 144 active cases in Saskatchewan as of September 27, with 15 new cases reported on the same date. Record high levels of testing were achieved on September 26, with nearly 3000 people getting tested in the province. The provincial government intends to hire additional lab staff in order to raise its testing capacity to 4000 a day. The president of the Métis Nation-Saskatchewan is facing calls to resign after he attended a fundraiser while awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test, which turned out to be positive. Glen McCallum reportedly did not wear a mask during the event and came into contact with over two dozen people. Attendees of the fundraiser were not informed that McCallum was awaiting test results. Employees of the hotel where the fundraiser was located said that McCallum repeatedly flouted the COVID-19 restrictions that they put in place, and they have had to close for several days to undergo deep cleaning. McCallum said that he was not told to self-isolate while waiting on the test results, arguing the officials who were asking for his resignation were “relying on gossip” which would discourage others from getting tested.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 20, there are 140 active cases of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan. Testing figures in the province have hit record highs this week. Over 20 cases of COVID-19 in the province are linked to a single social gathering in Saskatoon, including transmission to people who did not attend the gathering. The gathering had more attendees than permitted by the provincial government. The federal COVID-19 Alert app is now available in Saskatchewan. The provincial government has encouraged all Saskatchewan residents to download the app, which is voluntary. Jury trials in the province will resume later this month, with all trials held at a larger location than a courthouse to ensure social distancing regulations are followed. Increasing demand for online learning in Regina has caused a number of teachers to be shuffled into the program. Prior to moving additional staff into the program, there was a 67-to-1 student-teacher ratio. The Leader of the Opposition, Ryan Meili, has criticized Premier Moe for his comments on anti-mask protests in the province. Meili said that the premier needs to issue clear guidelines for when masks are appropriate to use -- and offer a stronger condemnation of the protests.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 9, Saskatchewan has 59 active cases of COVID-19, down from 106 on August 23. The provincial government has released its guidelines for parents and students on what to do if there is a positive COVID-19 case in a classroom. An outbreak will be declared if two persons within the same school test positive, but it does not immediately result in the school moving to distance learning. Schools will only move to online instruction if there are two or more cases in multiple classrooms around the school. Voluntary testing centres will be set up at various schools in Regina, Saskatoon, and Prince Albert to give students and staff priority access. The Chief Medical Health Officer said that Saskatchewan residents should keep close contacts to a minimum as students return to school. Premier Moe said the province would use the federal governmentís COVID alert app, which is expected to be available in Saskatchewan within the next few weeks. The provincial government also advised residents to avoid inter-provincial travel if they can as cases rise in other Western provinces.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 23, Saskatchewan had 106 active cases of COVID-19. This represents the lowest number of active cases in over a month; daily increases have remained under 10 for the past week. 65% of all active cases are linked to communal living settings. Masks will be mandatory for all bus passengers in Regina on August 31; buses will return to full capacity on the same date. Elections Saskatchewan said it would allow all those fearing the risk of COVID-19 to vote by mail in the upcoming provincial election. Premier Scott Moe announced that the government has pushed back the start of the school year to September 8. Moe also said that $40 million will be dedicated to costs associated with the school reopening plan. Additional contingency plans for outbreaks in schools will be released in the coming days. The provincial government rejected the Saskatchewan NDPís motion for an emergency debate on the school reopening plan, saying it was unnecessary. Leader of the Opposition Ryan Meili said that his party does not want the school year to be pushed back any further and that the government needs to find solutions to a variety of problems with their plan for schools.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Saskatchewan has 193 active cases as of August 16. Most infections are concentrated in Regina, Saskatoon, and Hutterite communities in the province. The Far North region of the province now has zero active cases for the first time since a major outbreak began there near the beginning of the pandemic. The city of Regina will recommend the use of masks on public transit and indoor public spaces, and may implement a mandatory policy in the weeks and months ahead. The Mayor of Regina said the provincial government was not opposed to a potential bylaw. Other municipalities expressed hope that the province would implement the policy universally. Two Saskatchewan First Nations communities released their school reopening guidelines. In contrast to the provinceís plan, the communities plan to implement smaller class sizes, mask-wearing when distancing is not possible, and plexiglass barriers between desks. The Saskatchewan Teachers Federation is reportedly exploring the possibility of a strike if the provinceís guidelines on school reopening are not altered.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Saskatchewan began to release more detailed COVID case information on August 4, with new maps showing the spread in various parts of the province. The province also announced its school reopening plan on August 4. All students are expected to attend in-person and are not required to wear masks.  The plan does not include a reduction in class sizes. The Ministry of Education is planning to purchase several million additional masks for staff and students if the situation in the province worsens. The NDPís education critic and the leader of the provinceís teachers union criticized the reopening plan, saying it did not offer clear guidelines for moving from one stage to another and did not prioritize the safety of students and educators. A number of teachers, parents, and students also criticized the plan, with some teachers saying they would rather retire or teach from home than return under the circumstances. Education Minister Gord Wyant defended the plan, saying the decision to not mandate the use of masks was up to the provinceís Chief Medical Health Officer.  A number of school boards in the province will recommend their use anyway.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 3, the number of active cases in the province is now at 254. Testing centres are reaching their capacity and hospital admissions are rising. Premier Moe warned residents of Saskatchewan not to give in to COVID-19 fatigue as cases associated with community transmission rise in the province. He said that new outbreaks would not affect the provinceís reopening plan. Moe said that the province is considering implementing a mandatory mask policy and that full details on the school reopening plan will be issued within the next week. Opposition Leader Meili said that the province has not been clear enough in its recommendation of mask use, its school reopening plan, or in the benchmarks used to ease the provinceís lockdown restrictions. The chair of the Hutterite Safety Council said that naming specific colonies that have COVID-19 outbreaks is stigmatizing the whole community and that their relationship with the province is deteriorating. Health officials will visit all 80 Hutterite colonies in the province to disseminate information on COVID-19 after a leaked Saskatchewan Health Authority document showed that the estimated Rt rate in the South region of the province is now at 3.14.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 21, the provincial government announced that garage sales and door-to-door canvassing will be permitted going forward. Saskatchewan is the only province with an election scheduled for this year, and parties will be able to send volunteers to canvass potential voters. Fitness facilities may resume operating at all hours, and drive-in theatres may increase their capacity. Saskatchewan reported 60 new cases on July 22, another record-high for the province. Many of the cases are linked to Hutterite communities in the South region of the province. Despite reports of tension between the province and Hutterite community leaders, Premier Moe said that most communities have been receptive to COVID-19 precautions. Premier Moe and Opposition Leader Ryan Meili both said that the long wait times for testing were unacceptable, and that the government is working on expanding test capacity in the province.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Saskatchewan reported 42 new cases on July 16, the largest single-day increase since the pandemic began. Fourteen communities in the province have been identified as having an elevated rate of transmission. Visits to hospitals and long-term care facilities in the South region have been restricted. The Saskatchewan Union of Nurses is calling on the province to immediately implement a mandatory mask policy due to the jump in cases. The province had previously said it would further monitor the spread of COVID-19 before considering such a policy. The province will return to providing daily updates on the COVID-19 cases after a jump in cases on the weekend. Saskatchewan NDP Leader Ryan Meili said that only providing updates on weekdays does not give people in Saskatchewan all the information they need to know when entering their community. Meili also questioned the provinceís different approaches to COVID-19 outbreaks in the North and South regions, with travel restrictions imposed on Northern communities but not on those in the South.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The provinceís Office of Residential Tenancies will begin accepting applications from landlords to evict their tenants on August 4, five months after they were suspended. The Minister of Justice said that tenants will be given the opportunity to pay back unpaid rent over the course of several months, and the eviction process will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The provincial government announced that public schools will be in-person in the fall, but has yet to release guidelines for immunocompromised students, teachers, and staff on how they should proceed if there is another outbreak. Elections Saskatchewan says it is working to source $500,000 worth of PPE in preparation for the provincial election on October 26. All residents are expected to be able to vote by mail, but current plans are to have polling stations open for anyone who wants to cast a ballot in person.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The provincial government announced that the 50% capacity restriction on restaurants will be lifted on July 6, but physical distancing must be maintained. Health officials and business owners expressed confidence in the cancellation of the capacity limit. Indoor athletic and performing arts activities may also resume on July 6, while racetracks and rodeo-related activities can resume on July 16. Contact sports like hockey and football were permitted on June 29, but travelling for competitions and the number of participants at each game must be limited. Visits to long-term care facilities will be expanded on July 7, allowing more people to serve as support persons for critical and end-of-life care. A heated debate between the opposition NDP and the governing Saskatchewan Party broke out during Question Period on July 2, after the opposition criticized the government for reducing the provinceís inventory of a variety of health supplies in 2014. The health minister responded by saying that it sounded like the NDP were disappointed that the pandemic did not hit Saskatchewan harder than it has.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The second part of Phase 4 of the provinceís reopening plan will commence on June 29, with cultural institutions allowed to reopen. Cinemas and live theatres can reopen at 30% capacity (or a maximum of 150 people), while visitors to museums and libraries must be able to maintain social distance. Outdoor sports games and activities are allowed to resume, though social distancing should be maintained if possible. Parks and campgrounds may open at full capacity for overnight stays and limited term campsites. All workers at personal care services, fitness centres and restaurants must wear a mask when social distancing cannot be maintained. The reopening of indoor pools, indoor sports and other entertainment venues will be announced within the next two weeks. The provinceís Chief Medical Health Officer has said that discussions are underway to lift the governmentís recommendation against non-essential interprovincial travel. While the provincial government advises Saskatchewan residents to avoid going to other provinces, it does not enforce an isolation period upon their return.</p>
