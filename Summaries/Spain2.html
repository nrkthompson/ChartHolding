      The government expressed an intention to maintain their preventive isolation measures in June. Half of Spain remains in phase one, but the rest of the country progressed to phase two as of May 25th with increased social activities, work opportunities, and gatherings. With health restrictions, beaches, bars, malls, cultural locations, museums, and libraries reopened in parts of Spain. The Ministry of Health released recommendations for distancing, capacity, and cleaning practices at beaches.  On July 1st, Spain will lift their two week quarantine rule for international travelers and will begin gradually accepting international tourists. In the final phase of their reopening plan, Spain expects increased general movement and increased capacity in public spaces.  Supporters of Spain’s Vox Party organized a protest called the “Caravan for Spain and Liberty”, the protests took place in Madrid, Barcelona, and Seville in cars and on foot.
