      In a radio interview, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has admitted that Sweden should have committed itself to a more restrictive lockdown strategy than what was undertaken. Tegnell later backtracked his remarks in the interview, saying that he stands by Sweden’s strategy as a whole but that there is room for improvement. These statements come after Tegnell has been defiant against criticism of the country’s strategy, while insisting that Sweden’s approach was more sustainable than the harsh lockdowns undertaken elsewhere. PM Lofven bowed to opposition party pressure to appoint an independent commission to investigate the country’s COVID-19 response before the summer begins, after previously expressing his desire to wait until the pandemic is over. Nearly 8000 people gathered at an anti-racism protest in Stockholm on June 3, which was eventually broken up by police due to the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. Organizers were initially given permission for the protest to go ahead, but the crowd size swelled rapidly. The government issued a statement that said it gave permission for the protest because it is the organizer’s responsibility to ensure their event meets social distancing guidelines, but it became clear that they lost control of the crowd and police were needed to maintain the 50-person limit. The government has also announced changes to its testing strategy, with any person with symptoms able to get tested (rather than a priority system) and the resumption of contact tracing for all those who test positive. Health Minister Lena Hallengren did not specify when this policy would be implemented, and said that it would be up to each region how they opt to test their population.
