      Bars that do not serve food were allowed to reopen this week with some restrictions. Establishments are limited to table service and must close by 11:30pm and gatherings are limited to 20 people with a minimum 1 metre distance between people not from the same household. Several other changes to quarantine rules were also announced. People who come into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 no longer need to isolate themselves, unless they live in the same household or have a close relationship. Business travellers from Nordic countries no longer need to isolate themselves when leaving and entering Norway.
