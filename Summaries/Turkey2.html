      Intercity trains resumed operations on May 28, with tickets being sold at half their original price through ticket offices, websites and mobile applications. Trains are scheduled to make 16 trips daily, with passengers maintaining physical distancing guidelines. Friday prayers are expected to resume by May 29 with strict hygienic measures in place - such as requiring ritual ablution to be performed at home, the use of masks, and personal prayer rugs recommended at mosques. The world-famous Konyaalt? beach in Turkey is also all set to reopen by June 1 with strict hygienic and social distancing rules in place. Beachgoers will no longer be allowed to lay their towels indiscriminately on the sand to sunbathe; instead, warning signs will be placed with 9m of designated space between each beachgoer to prevent crowding and close proximity among tourists. Beachgoers will have to wait until 20 minutes after the previous user has left before claiming a beach area. Social distancing lanes will be placed in areas with changing cabins and showers. The reopening of beaches comes after the announcement of the “healthy tourism certificate” programme, set to launch by June 1st, with an aim to  convince travellers that it is safe to visit Turkey’s beaches and historic treasures this year. This certificate sets criteria for health and hygiene in airlines, airports and other transport, as well as hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes, and will be awarded by international institutions, and the information be sent to tour operators.
