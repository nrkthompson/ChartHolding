  <h5>February 15, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Slovakia reported 572 cases of COVID-19 on February 15, below its 7-day moving average of 2,024 cases per day. Forty-four of Slovakia’s 72 administrative regions are at level 3 out of 4 on the country’s regional alert scale, compared to forty-one last week. Level 3 permits the reopening of kindergartens and primary schools for in-person learning, as well as the resumption of many non-essential activities for residents who have had a negative COVID-19 test in the past 7 days.</p> 
  <h5>February 8, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Slovakia reported 552 cases of COVID-19 on February 7, below its 7-day moving average of 1,916 cases per day. From February 8, Slovakia will begin using a colour-coded regional alert system in order to establish localized public health guidelines.  This is in addition to a similar national alert system already in use. Slovakia’s state of emergency was extended on February 8, with the country remaining at the most restrictive “black” phase of its national alert system. Forty-one of Slovakia’s 72 administrative regions will begin the week at level 3 out of 4 on the country’s regional alert scale, which permits the reopening of kindergartens and primary schools for in-person learning, as well as the resumption of many non-essential activities for residents who had a negative COVID-19 test in the past 7 days.</p> 
  <h5>February 1, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Slovakia reported 1,723 cases of COVID-19 on January 31, below its 7-day moving average of 2,062 cases per day. The country will remain in lockdown until February 7, with ongoing restrictions shuttering all non-essential establishments, including theatres, hairdressers, driving schools, and fitness centres. Only essential businesses, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, can remain open at this time. Gatherings remain limited to two people. As of February 1, Slovakians who can produce a negative COVID-19 test, or prove that they have received an approved vaccine, are exempt from the most restrictive lockdown measures, such as limitations on movement outside of the home during curfew hours.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Slovakia reported 1,905 cases of COVID-19 on January 24, a significant improvement from its single-day record of 6,315 new cases on December 31. The country will remain in lockdown until January 31, with ongoing restrictions shuttering all non-essential establishments, including theatres, hairdressers, driving schools, and fitness centres. Only essential businesses, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, can remain open at this time. All mass events, including those with fewer than 6 people, remain prohibited.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Slovakia reported 573 cases of COVID-19 on January 17, just over two weeks after setting the country’s single-day record of 6,315 new cases. The country will remain in lockdown until January 31, with ongoing restrictions shuttering all non-essential establishments, including theatres, hairdressers, driving schools, and fitness centres. Only essential businesses, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, can remain open at this time. All mass events, including those with fewer than 6 people, remain prohibited. Shoe repair shops were added to the country’s list of essential businesses on January 11.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite the reported success of SlovakiaÕs mass-testing and quarantine operation -- in which millions of Slovakians were tested for COVID-19 twice over a 3-week period -- the country is experiencing a major resurgence. A record 3,991 new cases were reported on December 20; the previous single-day record of 3,363 new cases was on October 30. New restrictions were introduced this week on the recommendation of SlovakiaÕs pandemic commission, with the current lockdown set to last until January 10, 2021. Under new restrictions, all commercial establishments must close, including theatres, hairdressers, driving schools, and fitness centres. Only essential businesses, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, can remain open. All mass events, including those with fewer than 6 people, are prohibited.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite the reported success of SlovakiaÕs mass-testing and quarantine operation -- in which millions of Slovakians were tested for COVID-19 twice over a 3-week period -- the country is experiencing a major resurgence of COVID-19 this week.  It reported a record 3,707 new cases on December 12. This spike in cases comes as a surprise after nearly a month of declining single-day counts. In light of the countryÕs deteriorating epidemiological situation, SlovakiaÕs pandemic commission has proposed that lockdown restrictions be implemented once again. The proposed rules would be similar to those imposed after the first round of mass testing. This means that it would be possible to leave the house in order to shop for essentials and walk to school or work. The commission suggested that the lockdown be put in place until January 10, 2021. The proposal first needs to be approved by the cabinet. The health minister has stressed that it is necessary to impose the lockdown as soon as possible.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Slovakian prime minister, the countryÕs mass-testing and quarantine operation -- in which millions of Slovakians were tested twice over a 3-week period -- has helped to cut the new infections in the country by more than half. With a total population of 5.5 million, Slovakia tested 3.6 million people during the first weekend of November and moved those testing positive into quarantine. Slovakia repeated the test for just over 2 million people last weekend, with a much lower infection rate.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the spread of COVID-19 in Slovakia continues to slow, the countryÕs government is gradually easing restrictions in key areas. From November 27, 2020, public gatherings can take place in groups of up to 6 people -- provided that all participants have a negative RT-PCR or antigen test result within 12 hours. The second round of nationwide testing that was set to take place during the first weekend of December has been cancelled due to the fact that the country does not have enough antigen tests. The economy minister was assigned to purchase 16 million antigen tests; the first batch of four million tests is expected to be delivered by December 2.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following the reportedly successful testing of over 80% of the countryÕs population, SlovakiaÕs government reopened theatres, cinemas and churches at half capacity on November 15 and allowed fitness centres and pools to resume operation with limited capacity. SlovakiaÕs ice hockey and soccer leagues also resumed without spectators on November 20. As the spread of COVID-19 in Slovakia continues to slow, the countryÕs prime minister has announced that his government will re-conduct nationwide mass testing in December based on the success of the initial run in Òcontaining the pandemic.Ó</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While many European countries continue to lockdown as COVID-19 infections continue to rise, SlovakiaÕs government reopened theatres, cinemas and churches at half capacity on November 15. The country is also allowing fitness centres and pools to operate with limited capacity as of the same date. SlovakiaÕs ice hockey and soccer leagues will also restart, without spectators, on November 20. Slovakia reported 2,024 new infections on November 12 -- down from a record daily tally of more than 3,000 in late October.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">SlovakiaÕs government has tested 4.5 million people out of its 5.5 million population for COVID-19 in the past 2 weeks using rapid antigen tests. The tests are voluntary and free of charge. Just over 1%, or 38,000, of the tests administered so far have come back positive. The government declared a state of emergency earlier this month in response to this surge in infections. Secondary schools have switched to remote learning. All mass events, including church services, are banned. Fitness centres and pools are closed and restaurants can only serve clients outdoors.</p>
