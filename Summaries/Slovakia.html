  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the spread of COVID-19 in Slovakia continues to slow, the country’s government is gradually easing restrictions in key areas. From November 27, 2020, public gatherings can take place in groups of up to 6 people -- provided that all participants have a negative RT-PCR or antigen test result within 12 hours. The second round of nationwide testing that was set to take place during the first weekend of December has been cancelled due to the fact that the country does not have enough antigen tests. The economy minister was assigned to purchase 16 million antigen tests; the first batch of four million tests is expected to be delivered by December 2.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following the reportedly successful testing of over 80% of the country’s population, Slovakia’s government reopened theatres, cinemas and churches at half capacity on November 15 and allowed fitness centres and pools to resume operation with limited capacity. Slovakia’s ice hockey and soccer leagues also resumed without spectators on November 20. As the spread of COVID-19 in Slovakia continues to slow, the country’s prime minister has announced that his government will re-conduct nationwide mass testing in December based on the success of the initial run in “containing the pandemic.”</p>
