      On May 30, the Polish government proceeded to the fourth phase of its plan for lifting restrictions related to COVID-19, reopening cinemas, theatres, gyms, massage parlours, and hair salons. Polish residents are no longer required to use a mask in outdoor spaces, provided that they can maintain at least two metres of distance between each other. Masks will still be required in many confined spaces and indoor venues, such as shops, churches, buses and streetcars. Limits on the number of people allowed to enter various indoor venues have been lifted, including catering establishments, churches, and government service centers, all of which are being allowed to operate at full capacity, provided that they are able to maintain a safe distance between patrons. Limits on mass gatherings have increased, with weddings, outdoor concerts, and other public gatherings now being limited to 150 guests. Hotels were allowed to fully reopen all of their facilities -  including gyms, swimming pools, bars, and restaurants - on June 6. Poland has experienced a resurgence in cases following its latest steps towards reopening, reporting 599 new cases of COVID-19 on June 8 - its largest single day increase since the start of the pandemic.
