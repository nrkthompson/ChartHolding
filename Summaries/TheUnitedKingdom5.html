      The UK's COVID-19 death toll has surpassed 53,000. Watchdogs and authorities are using the number of excess deaths, which is currently double the average number of deaths last year, as a method for measuring the full impact of the COVID-19 crisis directly and indirectly. Unlike most countries, the UK is not tracking the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19. This has made public health experts question the effectiveness of contact tracing, since they do not know who has recovered. The Government is abandoning the COVID-19 app it developed in May, and will now subscribe to the Apple-Google model, which recognizes 99% of smartphones. This U-turn has caused the official opposition to question how much money was spent on the original app. On June 15, "non-essential" retailers - those selling fashion, toys and books, among other items - reopened across England. Hygienic restrictions are in place, such as a limit on the number of customers allowed in each store, discouraging customers from unnecessarily touching merchandise and closing fitting rooms. Without tourists, businesses expect to see around 10 to 15% of its normal customer base this week. Non-essential retail stores in Scotland and Wales have not opened. Plans to reopen eateries by July 4 might be delayed. President Macron will not have to quarantine for 14 days when he travels to London on June 18 to meet with Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the 80th anniversary of the French Resistance and post-Brexit discussions.
