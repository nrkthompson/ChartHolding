      This week, the average reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Germany remained below the 1.0 target.45 However, on June 17, Germany reported a spike of 1,100 cases due to an outbreak at a Toennies GmbH meatpacking plant in Guetersloh, which accounted for 657 positive cases. The plant was closed, 7,000 people were quarantined, and schools and childcare facilities in the region were ordered to close starting June 19 until June 29, nevertheless there are no plans for a broader lockdown.46 This is a part of Germany's local intervention strategy, where each municipality/state has the authority to close sectors if there is an outbreak.47 This outbreak prompted officials to criticize the living conditions of workers in the meatpacking industry, where social distancing is impossible.48 On June 16, Germany launched its contact tracing app Covid-Warn-App. It is intended to complement, not replace, existing low-tech contact tracing efforts, which rely on calling people who test positive to ask about their movements within the last 48 hours.49 The launch comes at a time when EU states are discussing guidelines for interoperability to track cases across the EU, with the creation of a central gateway to handle data traffic between the apps based on the Google-Apple standard.50 While using the software is voluntary, its success depends on how many people download and register with the app. In response to privacy concerns, the app has an added layer of security protecting the identity of the user from other users and from the government.51
