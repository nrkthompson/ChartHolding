      Effective June 15, shared toilets and ablution facilities belonging to outdoor and high-performance sports centers, zoos, amusement parks, public swimming pools and public libraries opened to the public, along with major educational institutions. Lecture halls are allowed to fill up to a maximum capacity of 20 percent in universities, with classes set to run between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m, and then again after 8 p.m. to avoid rush hour congestion. On the following day, travel advice to 16 European countries also relaxed to the public, with holiday trips allowed to most EU countries. The advice went from code orange, which discourages all unnecessary trips, to code yellow, which warns of safety risks to travelers. Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Ireland are not yet among code yellow countries. An  entry ban to the  people arriving from outside the EU is also extended until July 1. However, the ban is not applicable to EU citizens, and their family members. Holders of a residency permit or long-stay visas for the Netherlands, people with vital functions, such as healthcare- and border workers, people employed in transportation of goods, and even diplomats and military personnel, are also exempted from the ban.

      As of June 8, all primary schools in the Netherlands reopened completely for the first time since mid-March, after operating partially on alternate shifts since May 11. Effective June 15, the government also plans to reopen its borders for EU nationals as part of its phase three reopening strategy, in an effort to boost the tourism industry. Tourists from twelve EU states, which contain lower rates of COVID-19 cases, would be eligible to holiday in the Netherlands. These states are Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Estonia, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic. As of now, citizens of Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom cannot travel to the Netherlands. According to the Dutch authorities, foreign tourists must comply with all the measures and rules that apply in the country to combat the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, tourists are encouraged to reserve their holiday accommodation before they travel to the Netherlands, without which they may be stopped at the border.

      Various sectors reopened as the Netherlands entered phase 2 of its reopening strategy on June 1. On that day, restaurants and bars reopened with a 1.5m distance rule, a capacity limit of 30 customers indoors with a pre-reservation system. While staff at restaurants were required to carry out temperature checks for all customers, the local officials of restaurants in four big cities disagreed to do so, unless under extenuating circumstances. Cinemas, theatres and concert halls reopened on a ticket-only basis with an audience capacity limit of 30 individuals, along with art music schools and museums, which reopened with pre-reservations and bookings along with social distancing measures to follow. Visits to nursing homes and other institutional care homes were also further relaxed from their previous restriction of 1 visit per person to now unlimited visits. On June 2, face masks became compulsory on public transport with a fine of up to €95 for non-compliance. COVID-19 testing became widely available to those even without a doctor’s referral, with the government urging individuals with a loss of smell or taste to get themselves tested as it is a prominent sign of the virus. Effective June 2, secondary schools and special education schools also reopened again with rotational shifts and preventive measures such as requiring pupils to walk or cycle to school unless their home distance from schools is far enough and is only commutable through public transport. However, pre-school, after school care and primary schools are scheduled to reopen in full capacity by June 8, after considering the successful reopening of partial primary schools.  Trade schools, colleges and universities are set to reopen for practical lessons and exams on June 15.

      Bars and restaurants are scheduled to  reopen within the second stage of the deconfinement strategy, effective June 1st, allowing up to 30 guests inside with unlimited numbers outside, provided a 1.5 metre distance is maintained. Cinemas, theatres, and concert halls are also subject to open to a 30 guest maximum. Face masks are mandatory on public transport for anyone 13 and over, with a fine of 95 euros charged to those in violation. Public transport unions are concerned over the execution of monitoring and penalization of violators on public transport but were assured that effective inspection on trains by chief conductors and local authorities on buses and trams would occur. The Dutch Muslim Association also recommended the application of face masks and gloves during prayers, since groups of up to 30 will be allowed to attend services on June 1st.  As of May 26th, the Netherlands borders are  open for tourists from Schengen countries, which allow free movement without a visa, while U.K. citizens are permitted only upon full declaration of their health.

      After the government announced a 5 phase plan on reopening the Netherlands, effective May 11th, Amsterdam's mayor objected to the equal implementation of easing policies within all regions. She suggested that easing policies be implemented slowly within regions where the population is more dense, as a second outbreak would most  likely result if steps were taken too swiftly. On May 19th, the PM defended his stance of having a single national plan and confirmed that the second phase of the reopening plan would come into effect on June 1st.  Restaurants and bars will be able to reopen after 12 pm, with up to 30 guests, given that they adhere to the 1.5 metre distance rule. Cinemas and museums will be able to reopen under strict social distancing rules, with limited capacity in halls. All public transport users will be required to wear masks, as traffic will get busier with every reopening stage. High schools will reopen by June 2nd and elementary schools will return to full schedules by June 8th. Care homes will be permitted to have visitors again on May 25th, as more widespread testing will be available to reduce risks. The PM also signaled an increase in the number of visitors to the elderly homes by June 15th,  upon successful testing in the previous stage. Mucus swab testing for active COVID-19 infections will also become more widely available in June, with those testing positive to be quarantined. Gyms and dance venues  remain closed, with large sporting events banned until September.
