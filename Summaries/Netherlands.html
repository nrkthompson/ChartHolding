  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 6, the number of positive COVID-19 cases rose by 288 in the previous 24 hours, for a total of 7,272 cases. The government announced a further tightening of existing measures that came into effect on November 4 and will be in place for two weeks. The measures include a maximum of two people from different households permitted to gather indoors and outdoors. Masks are compulsory in indoor public spaces and on public transport for everyone 13 and older. Amusement parks, cinemas, community centers, museums, and live theaters are closed, along with swimming pools, sex clubs and zoos. However, most fitness centers remain open only for individual training. Starting November 9, weddings cannot exceed 20 people and funerals are capped at 30 people. Retail stores will close at 8 pm but grocery stores can remain open. Between 8 pm and 7 am, no alcohol can be sold or consumed in public spaces. School closures and curfews in high risk areas are under consideration.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 30, approximately 11,141 people have tested positive for COVID-19. The total is 11% higher than last week’s total. The public health minister stated that no additional measures are currently needed, beyond the partial lockdown in place. Strict measures will be adopted if the number of cases continues to rise. The Dutch general election has been scheduled to take place over three days in order to spread out voting and prevent crowds. According to the government, early voting and postal voting for people unable to cast their vote in person for medical reasons will also be an option by the next general election on March 17.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 23, the number of newly registered COVID-19 cases topped 10,000 for the first time in 24 hours. Testing capacity has been expanded considerably since early October, allowing up to 50,000 tests per day. The government stated that it is too soon to tell if the partial lockdown announced on October 13 has had a positive impact on curbing the spread of infections within the country, which included the closure of all cafes and bars. The government believes that closing schools and nursing homes would have had a greater impact on reducing the infection rate.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 18, the number of new COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands reached 8,141. Effective October 14, the Netherlands went into partial lockdown with cafes, bars, and restaurants required to shut down by 10pm for at least 4 weeks, with only take-away permitted. Hotels will stay open, but their restaurants are only available for hotel guests. Indoor and outdoor gatherings are limited to 4 people. Team sports for adults in groups have been stopped. Shops are no longer able to open in the evening, apart from food stores, given they follow proper hygiene rules and store limits. The government plans to make face masks compulsory in all indoor public spaces. The measures implemented would be assessed after two weeks for progress but if the number of cases continues rising after 4 weeks, a total lockdown may occur.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of new COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands has been increasing rapidly since early September, and now has one of the highest numbers of infections per capita. Around 6,504 additional people have tested positive, a new single-day record. The rapid increase in the number of cases has been linked to the reluctant behaviour of the Dutch population to adopt a mandatory face mask rule. The National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) has also attributed the rise to young people returning from holidays abroad in Spain and France over the summer. The government is considering enforcing an earlier closing time for the catering industry, but an official curfew seems unlikely. On October 10, the Dutch COVID-19 app “CoronaMelder” went online for all users across the Netherlands. It was in development for over 6 months, including 2 months of beta testing in 5 of the country's 25 security regions.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 3, the Dutch government formally recommended face masks, despite disagreement by public health advisors on its effectiveness, in restaurants, cafes, theatres, bars, contact-based services such as salons, and concert halls, unless people are seated. Non-medical masks are now recommended in indoor public spaces for those aged 13 and older. The education ministry has decided to recommend masks be worn in all secondary schools, but not at colleges and universities where social distancing is easier, however it is up to schools themselves to decide whether or not to make masks a requirement. Following a rise in the number of new cases, nearly all of the Netherlands has been declared an international risk area by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Germany. Residents of Germany are being warned against visiting ten of the twelve Dutch provinces. As of October 5, churches have been advised to limit the number of worshippers to 30, hold services online as much as possible, and ban singing.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 25, the Netherlands announced it will likely be implementing new measures within a few more regions, to combat the spread of COVID-19 infections. Effective September 28, eight new regions will be added to the list of six areas including Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, which are already under special measures. The six regions which went to level 2 faced new restrictions, with bars forced to close by 1 a.m. and a maximum of 50 people allowed for any indoor or outdoor gathering. However, exceptions were made for many events, including religious gatherings and funerals. Effective September 29, the audience will be banned from football matches, bars will be closed at 10 p.m., and only essential travel will be permitted to and from Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. Working from home will also be more strictly enforced, with businesses facing temporary closure if they fail to adhere to the guidelines. Only essential journeys to the three largest cities Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague will be permitted, with some exceptions. Contact professions, such as hairdressers and physiotherapists, will be required to take details of customers so they can be alerted in the event of a positive case. Shoppers in supermarkets will be required to use trolleys that have been disinfected prior to use.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">For any gatherings that include more than 50 people, a permit from local authorities will have to be provided. Effective September 19, teaching staff and healthcare workers will be given priority at COVID-19 testing centres. The aim is to test essential workers in the morning so they have their results in the afternoon and know whether or not they can continue to go to work. They will be able to use a special phone line to make an appointment, which will guarantee priority. The new situation will apply to primary and secondary school workers who cannot be replaced, and whose classes would be sent home if there was no supervision. In healthcare, nursing and other staff whose services are essential for patient care will be given priority if there is no suitable replacement.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In the past week, a sharp rise has been recorded in the number of COVID-19 infections. Most of the new cases are among people in their 20s, with an infection rate almost double that of people in their 30s. The start of the new university and college year has been blamed for the rise. The PM announced an extension to the current restrictions in place on September 1, including the sustained closure of night clubs and bars, and stricter rules for gatherings. The so-called ìcheering banî also remains in force, which refers to singing and shouting in crowds -- such as ones that form during demonstrations, protests, sports games, competitions and concerts. Quarantine for those returning from orange-labelled countries will be required to stay at home for a period of 10 days. Children younger than 4 will be allowed to attend childcare facilities and take part in sports activities. Children ages 4 - 12 will be allowed to return to school. In nursing homes, staff are being trained extensively in using protective equipment. Both residents and employees will be tested on a weekly basis.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective August 18, new measures have been implemented in the Netherlands--including a restriction on the gathering limit to 6 people. Working from home is encouraged to continue in fall. However, the duration of home quarantine has been reduced from 14 days to 10. The PM said Amsterdam and Rotterdam could expect extra measures since both cities became significant hotspots around the end of June. Most universities are starting their introductory weeks online, with in person meetings allowed only if essential.  However, some universities are opting for in person classes with strict measures in place. At Delft University of Technology, for instance, most studying and working will take place outside the TU Delft buildings, according to its new protocol. To help spread out the number students, study days will start at 8am and last until 8pm, and on-campus teaching will be in groups of 10 to 20 students. With schools starting to reopen after summer vacation, several concerns have been raised about the safety of children. Since the end of June, the total number of infections among those aged 15 to 19 saw an almost four-fold increase according to RIVM. A number of Dutch schools have made face masks compulsory even in the absence of a clear guideline from health institute RIVM, the Outbreak Management Team and the cabinet. However, not all schools have imposed the same rules. Some schools only require pupils and staff to wear the masks in the corridors, while others have made face masks compulsory for year 4 pupils and up--including in the classroom.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 15, the Netherlands placed Paris, Ibiza, Madrid and Brussels on its code orange list of places where all but essential travel is advised against. The French, Spanish and Belgian capitals have been added to the orange list, as have the Balearic islands (including Majorca and Ibiza), and the Spanish provinces of Burgos, Salamanca, Almeria and Navarra. The French Bouches-du-Rhone region, close to Aix-en-Provence and Marseille, is also out of bounds. The Health Ministry has warned against all non-essential travel to these places.  Anyone returning to the Netherlands from these cities and regions are required to quarantine for 14 days. Britain has also been added to the code orange list, but travellers will not have to quarantine on their return to the Netherlands. Travel advice to the UK has been tightened up as a warning--following the quarantine requirements set by the UK for people arriving from the Netherlands.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 7, Amsterdamís regional health board announced its decision to cut back on tracing the contacts of people who tested positive for COVID-19. This is due to a shortage of capacity. The surge in infections within the region has made it impossible to carry out thorough tracing until more staff are trained. Those who test positive are being advised to inform their own network about possible transmission. New measures were announced by the government effective August 6, including holding of freshersí week activities online, as much as possible, with physical meetings only permitted to introduce a sport or an educational programme. Cafes, bars and restaurants are advised to use a reservation system and register the contact details of all guests so they can be traced in case of an outbreak. Should there be an outbreak, the local authorities must close down the cafe, cinema, museum or amusement park for 14 days. Testing will be introduced at all Dutch airports for people returning to the Netherlands from high risk areas. Checks based on passenger lists will be done to make sure arrivals are staying in quarantine for 14 days. Local public safety boards have been given the power to introduce localised measures. These include the right to impose curfews on cafes and night shops, the introduction of face masks, the closure of shopping centres and parks, the power to ban on large events and the right to scale up policing.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective August 1, Netherlands exempted the compulsory quarantine requirement for returning holidaymakers from countries branded code orange or red--along with mandatory testing of asymptomatic travelers who arrive in the country from destinations with a high number of COVID-19 cases. However, random testing will be carried out at airports, with travellers encouraged to self-quarantine at their homes upon return. Previously, people entering the Netherlands were advised to self-isolate for two weeks upon arrival from a country classified as "code red", where people should not visit under any circumstances, or from "code orange" countires, where people should only visit under extraordinary circumstances. Effective August 5, face masks will be made compulsory in busy parts of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, with fines imposed on those who fail to comply. The move came following a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Rotterdam in the past few weeks. Local health board officials have also closed three cafes in Amsterdam because they were potential sources of clusters and a staff member continued to work despite having symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With a rise in the number of daily infections, the Dutch governmentís special COVID-19 envoy has advised the public to take swift, visible actions to prevent the possibility of a second wave. The rise in infections have been linked to lack of social distancing measures, including non-application of masks, which may become mandatory outdoors in the coming weeks. Alcohol sales have also been restricted on weekends in one of Amsterdamís busiest tourist areas as a means of curbing transmission in the capital. Effective July 24, shops in the Wallen area, best known for its red light district, have been banned from selling alcohol from 4pm until midnight. However, alcohol can still be served at bars and restaurants. People from outside the EU are currently banned from entering the country but, effective July 27, the ban on foreign partners of Dutch people and non-temporary residents was lifted. Residents in a long distance relationship are allowed to have their partner visit them in the Netherlands, given that the relationship is at least three months in length and is a lasting one, affirmed through a signed, written statement. The couple must be able to demonstrate that they regularly saw each other before the travel restrictions. Partners must also have a return ticket -- with their visits capped at a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period. If the partner comes from a country with code orange travel advice, they will be strictly advised to quarantine themselves for two weeks.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective 16 July, British travellers to the Netherlands will no longer be asked to spend 14 days in quarantine upon arrival. People travelling from the UK and Sweden were strongly advised to go into isolation because of the higher levels of coronavirus infection in those countries when the Dutch border was reopened to EU and UK nationals on July 1. However, the non-binding advice was dropped for the UK after the British government included the Netherlands on its list of countries exempted from its own quarantine regime. The Netherlands is continuing to revise its travel advice in response to changing COVID-19 situations in the rest of Europe. On July 16, Bulgariaís status was changed to code orange ñ essential journeys only ñ following an increase in cases in the last few weeks. Travellers from Romania, two areas in Spain and two Portuguese regions are also advised to self-isolate on arrival, but the measure is not legally enforceable. Tourists are subject to the same rules as Dutch nationals, such as maintaining a social distance of 1.5 metres and wearing masks on public transport, and can be fined if they breach them. Another 14 non-EU countries including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Morocco and Algeria are included on a separate list of ësafeí countries that are exempt from quarantine. Sweden remains classified as code orange, along with Ireland; unlike the UK, they still requiring visitors from the Netherlands to self-isolate for 14 days.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 9, the Dutch football association published a protocol for clubs on how to restart matches while following social distancing rules. Public games have been allowed since July 1 as long as spectators keep a 1.5m distance. In an announcement on July 11, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs eased the cautionary travel advice for the UK from orange, indicating only urgent trips should be undertaken, to yellow. The decision was made after the UK itself loosened its own local rules. However, entry procedures from the Channel Islands ought to be stricter than the rest of the UK, considering the rise in the number of cases there.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 1, the Netherlands entered its normalization phase with new rules.  These rules were previously set to take effect on September 1, indicating an early success in restraining the spread of the virus.  The 1.5m distancing rule no longer applies on public transport. Seating next to each other in coaches is permitted. Non-family groups may now travel in the same car as long as everyone wears a mask. Outdoor events no longer have a limit, as long as social distancing is observed and people are seated. However, indoor events are capped at 100 people, excluding staff; seating is compulsory. Stadiums reopened for events with people are required to maintain physical distancing and avoid singing or chanting. Secondary schools are now able to provide lessons as normal; students are no longer required to keep a distance from each other, but must still keep a 1.5m distance from the teachers. Cafe terraces no longer need to adhere to the 1.5m rule between tables if protective screens are installed. Sex workers can resume work. Sport schools and gyms are allowed to hold competitive matches. Cross-border travel for Netherlands residents is allowed throughout the entire Schengen Area, with the exception of the UK and Sweden (which still remain at 'Code Orange' as of June 30, along with all travel outside of Europe). On July 3, the UK unveiled a list of quarantine-exempted countries, which includes the Netherlands: travelers from these countries are permitted to enter England without the need to quarantine on arrival.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A month after the Netherlands allowed restaurants, cinemas and cultural institutions to partially reopen, the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations remained low, making the likelihood of a second wave less likely for now. On June 22, following the decline, the government announced the reopening of gyms, saunas, casinos and sports canteens by July 1. In order for gyms, saunas, casinos and sports canteens to reopen, tighter hygiene regulations are required, which includes a requirement that facilities meet adequate ventilation standards. In August, secondary schools are set to reopen by region. The return of secondary school students also comes with new measures in place, requiring students to keep a 2m distance from their teachers rather than from one another. In addition to the expected new measures, the maximum number of people who can be present at funerals, marriages, religious gatherings, restaurants and movie theaters is also set to increase from 30 to 100 on July 1, given that a distance of 1.5m is maintained. Outdoor events will no longer have a maximum number of attendees as long as social distancing is observed and people are seated. Festivals will depend on local authority permits, but it is unlikely these will resume before mid-August. Football stadiums will reopen as long as social distancing rules apply, and sex workers will also be able to start working again effective July 1.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective June 15, shared toilets and ablution facilities belonging to outdoor and high-performance sports centers, zoos, amusement parks, public swimming pools and public libraries opened to the public, along with major educational institutions. Lecture halls are allowed to fill up to a maximum capacity of 20 percent in universities, with classes set to run between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m, and then again after 8 p.m. to avoid rush hour congestion. On the following day, travel advice to 16 European countries also relaxed to the public, with holiday trips allowed to most EU countries. The advice went from code orange, which discourages all unnecessary trips, to code yellow, which warns of safety risks to travelers. Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Ireland are not yet among code yellow countries. An  entry ban to the  people arriving from outside the EU is also extended until July 1. However, the ban is not applicable to EU citizens, and their family members. Holders of a residency permit or long-stay visas for the Netherlands, people with vital functions, such as healthcare- and border workers, people employed in transportation of goods, and even diplomats and military personnel, are also exempted from the ban.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 8, all primary schools in the Netherlands reopened completely for the first time since mid-March, after operating partially on alternate shifts since May 11. Effective June 15, the government also plans to reopen its borders for EU nationals as part of its phase three reopening strategy, in an effort to boost the tourism industry. Tourists from twelve EU states, which contain lower rates of COVID-19 cases, would be eligible to holiday in the Netherlands. These states are Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Estonia, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic. As of now, citizens of Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom cannot travel to the Netherlands. According to the Dutch authorities, foreign tourists must comply with all the measures and rules that apply in the country to combat the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, tourists are encouraged to reserve their holiday accommodation before they travel to the Netherlands, without which they may be stopped at the border.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Various sectors reopened as the Netherlands entered phase 2 of its reopening strategy on June 1. On that day, restaurants and bars reopened with a 1.5m distance rule, a capacity limit of 30 customers indoors with a pre-reservation system. While staff at restaurants were required to carry out temperature checks for all customers, the local officials of restaurants in four big cities disagreed to do so, unless under extenuating circumstances. Cinemas, theatres and concert halls reopened on a ticket-only basis with an audience capacity limit of 30 individuals, along with art music schools and museums, which reopened with pre-reservations and bookings along with social distancing measures to follow. Visits to nursing homes and other institutional care homes were also further relaxed from their previous restriction of 1 visit per person to now unlimited visits. On June 2, face masks became compulsory on public transport with a fine of up to Ä95 for non-compliance. COVID-19 testing became widely available to those even without a doctorís referral, with the government urging individuals with a loss of smell or taste to get themselves tested as it is a prominent sign of the virus. Effective June 2, secondary schools and special education schools also reopened again with rotational shifts and preventive measures such as requiring pupils to walk or cycle to school unless their home distance from schools is far enough and is only commutable through public transport. However, pre-school, after school care and primary schools are scheduled to reopen in full capacity by June 8, after considering the successful reopening of partial primary schools.  Trade schools, colleges and universities are set to reopen for practical lessons and exams on June 15.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Bars and restaurants are scheduled to  reopen within the second stage of the deconfinement strategy, effective June 1st, allowing up to 30 guests inside with unlimited numbers outside, provided a 1.5 metre distance is maintained. Cinemas, theatres, and concert halls are also subject to open to a 30 guest maximum. Face masks are mandatory on public transport for anyone 13 and over, with a fine of 95 euros charged to those in violation. Public transport unions are concerned over the execution of monitoring and penalization of violators on public transport but were assured that effective inspection on trains by chief conductors and local authorities on buses and trams would occur. The Dutch Muslim Association also recommended the application of face masks and gloves during prayers, since groups of up to 30 will be allowed to attend services on June 1st.  As of May 26th, the Netherlands borders are  open for tourists from Schengen countries, which allow free movement without a visa, while U.K. citizens are permitted only upon full declaration of their health.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After the government announced a 5 phase plan on reopening the Netherlands, effective May 11th, Amsterdam's mayor objected to the equal implementation of easing policies within all regions. She suggested that easing policies be implemented slowly within regions where the population is more dense, as a second outbreak would most  likely result if steps were taken too swiftly. On May 19th, the PM defended his stance of having a single national plan and confirmed that the second phase of the reopening plan would come into effect on June 1st.  Restaurants and bars will be able to reopen after 12 pm, with up to 30 guests, given that they adhere to the 1.5 metre distance rule. Cinemas and museums will be able to reopen under strict social distancing rules, with limited capacity in halls. All public transport users will be required to wear masks, as traffic will get busier with every reopening stage. High schools will reopen by June 2nd and elementary schools will return to full schedules by June 8th. Care homes will be permitted to have visitors again on May 25th, as more widespread testing will be available to reduce risks. The PM also signaled an increase in the number of visitors to the elderly homes by June 15th,  upon successful testing in the previous stage. Mucus swab testing for active COVID-19 infections will also become more widely available in June, with those testing positive to be quarantined. Gyms and dance venues  remain closed, with large sporting events banned until September.</p>
