      Restaurants and bars in Michigan started serving customers on-site, with capacity limits, on June 8. Public swimming pools and day camps were also allowed to reopen on June 8, with up to 50% capacity.6 On June 10, northern Michigan (including counties that border Canada) entered phase 5 of reopening, allowing salons, movie theaters and gyms to reopen with reduced capacity.7 Exactly 100 days after the first case was confirmed in New York, the City entered phase 1 of its reopening plan on June 8, allowing nonessential businesses, manufacturing, construction and select other industries to continue their work, with a limited capacity of 50%.8 Stores allowed customers to pick up goods either curbside or with in-person appointments. If the number of hospitalizations continues its downward trend, the City will follow the rest of the state and move on to the next phase by the end of the month.9 In Maine, 13 of the state’s 16 counties (all border counties with Canada) reopened gyms, bars and tasting rooms for outdoor service as part of the state’s rural reopening plan.10
