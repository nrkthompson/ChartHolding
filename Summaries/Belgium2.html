      The Interior Minister, Peter De Crem, said that if testing and contact tracing is not successful in managing a second wave of infections, it is likely that social distancing measures will be reimplemented in Belgium. Infrabel, the company responsible for Belgium's rail lines, are testing smart cameras with sensors to ensure its workers wear their masks and  maintain the new social distancing measures while on the job. While Belgium remains in their second phase, effective May 25th, changes occurred related to the easing of school closures. More grades at the primary and secondary level are able to return to school, with reopening being based on each school’s organizational capacities. The third phase is set to begin on June 8th and will focus on the reopening of restaurants, cultural and sporting events, and hotels. Unlike the outbreaks seen in other countries, Belgium has managed to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks at their meat manufacturing plants due to strict regulations related to working conditions and the housing of migrant workers. Belgium is aiming to reopen to international tourists by June 15th but currently advises against all non-essential travel abroad.Belgium's mayors have asked regional ministers to stop prematurely communicating to citizens about measures related to the country's exit plan after news is being announced without having been officially approved. Also, doctors and health officials are criticizing the country’s contact tracing system as inefficient and uncoordinated.
