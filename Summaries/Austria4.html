      Effective June 15, masks will no longer be mandatory in shops, schools and tourist areas. However, covering the mouth and nose will remain mandatory on public transit, in health facilities, including in pharmacies and in other service institutions where social distancing is hard to maintain, such as with hairdressers, beauty salons and in restaurants. Last week, Austria lifted border restrictions with all of its neighbouring countries with the exception of Italy. The Austrian government has since announced that on June 16, it will reopen its borders to more than 24 countries, including Italy. The decision should ease tensions after Austria singled out Italy for its continued high number of infections and deaths. All EU, EFTA (European Free Trade Association), and EEA (European Economic Area) states will be allowed to enter with the exception of Sweden, Great Britain, Spain and Portugal. Travellers entering Austria from other European countries will not be subject to quarantine nor required to show proof of a negative test.
