      On May 15, the Slovenian government declared itself the first European country to have put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic within its borders. The Slovenian government will regularly publish a list of countries whose citizens can enter without restrictions based on the COVID-19 situation in surrounding countries. As of now, citizens of Croatia can freely enter without restrictions, and talks with other countries are underway.  The first passenger flights to and from Slovenia are expected to resume on May 26th. In an effort to boost the tourism sector, Slovenia will be giving each citizen a voucher of up to 200 EUR, small hotels with less than 30 rooms will be allowed to reopen, while larger hotels are expected to reopen within the next month. Public gatherings of more than 50 people remain banned, and citizens are obliged to follow social distancing measures and wear face masks in public spaces. On May 18, all shops, bars and restaurants were allowed to reopen. Students in their first three years of primary schools, and pupils in their final years of highschool will return to school - but most will continue online lessons for the rest of the year.
