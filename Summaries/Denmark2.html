      The Scandinavian airline SAS, of which the Danish state is a major shareholder, is resuming a number of domestic and international flights this week after laying off nearly half of its workforce in April. Aircrafts will operate at a reduced capacity, though increasing the number of routes has doubled the number of planes needed to service passengers. Denmark and Norway have reached an agreement to open their border to each other’s tourists from June 15th, in a deal that excludes Sweden despite Swedish diplomatic pressure to open all Nordic nations at once. PM Frederiksen has been accused of lying to the Danish people in her initial announcement of lockdown restrictions by saying that the measures taken had been approved by state agencies. Records from the Public Health and Infectious Diseases agencies indicate that they did not recommend the strict restrictions that were implemented, and had even advised against some of them in the weeks prior to the announcement.
