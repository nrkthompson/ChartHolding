      The Icelandic government has said that gatherings of up to 200 people will be allowed from May 25th (previous limit was 50). On the same date, bars that do not serve food can reopen, but must close at 11pm, at the same time as the previously opened restaurant industry. Swimming pools were permitted to reopen at half their regular capacity on May 18th, while fitness centres will be able to do the same on May 25th. Iceland will be capable of testing up to 1000 tourists per day following the reopening of the border on June 15th, and has said that the state will pay for the tests for the time being.
