  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia is still grappling with the resurgence of transmission in Victoria, its second largest state. Victoria has recorded more than 200 new cases per day multiple times in the past week and has overtaken New South Wales to become the worst-affected state in Australia. A six-week lockdown of metropolitan Melbourne and its suburbs started on July 9, covering more than 5 million people. Residents have to stay at home and any gatherings with more than 2 people are prohibited. Victorians have also been urged to wear masks when leaving home. The National Cabinet decided on July 10 to reduce weekly arrivals into Australia from about 6,500 to 4,000 to ease pressure on hotel quarantine. Airlines are reportedly prioritizing bookings for business passengers. The Cabinet also agreed to a national review of hotel quarantine arrangements, with states and territories moving toward a model of charging for hotel quarantine. The states and territories are moving on with their own reopening plans, with the exception of Victoria. Three states have completely scrapped the limit on the maximum number of people attending gatherings. Restaurants are able to accommodate large groups of patrons. Non-essential shopping has returned in most cases. Travelling within the state is largely unlimited. Although Victoria’s borders remain open to travellers from most of the other states, all other states are either banning Victorians from entering or taking strict measures against them.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia has experienced a sudden spike in the past week: its daily new infections approach 100. Victoria continues reporting double-digit new cases, with a significant portion of these from community transmission. The local outbreaks in Victoria are spreading to other states through interstate travellers. The Northern Territory recorded its first new case, who was previously released from quarantine in Victoria after 42 days with no active infection. A one-month stay-at-home order was put in place for 36 suburbs of Melbourne on July 2. The premier of Victoria has also expressed his intention to divert all international flights from Melbourne for two weeks. The recent outbreaks have mostly been related to extended family gatherings and failures of hotel quarantine management. Victoria is still ramping up its number of testing sites. Checkpoints have been set up by police officers in the COVID-19 hotspots to help enforce the localized lockdowns. The national Cabinet has agreed on a coordinated, cross-jurisdictional response to the local outbreaks, which will be based on cooperating on transmission surge management and enhancing public health capacity. Further testing will be conducted for those in hotel quarantine both at the beginning and in the last few days in quarantine. While the situation in Victoria has disrupted the reopening locally, the other states continue to ease their restrictions at varied paces. The federal government has said that, by the end of July, all states and territories will remove attendance caps for indoor venues if physical distancing is practised. Three states already scrapped the limit on the number of people for gatherings outdoors and at restaurants. Interstate borders will be mostly reopened by mid-July except to Victoria.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Even though Australia maintains a low level of new infections nationwide, Victoria, its second-largest state, has logged more than ten new cases per day for the past week, accounting for almost all the locally acquired cases. Victoria is extending its state of emergency until July 19. Six local government areas have been designated as outbreak hotspots, and so traveling to and from these areas is discouraged. These hotspots will be targeted with extra testing, pop-up clinics and “door-to-door” engagement from health officials. Responding to Victoria’s request, the Australian Defence Force will provide more than 1,000 personnel to help with the COVID-19 response. There are large variations between the pace of reopening in different states, but further relaxation is expected at the start of July. However, Victoria will be reversing part of its easing plan by reducing the maximum number of people at gatherings, events and businesses. While the least-affected states allow for 100 or more people at gatherings, only 10 to 20 are permitted in the most affected states. The maximum number of people at home gatherings ranges from 20 to unlimited. For restaurants, cafes and pubs the lowest capacity limits are 20 patrons; by contrast, the Northern Territory and Western Australia have scrapped capacity limits as long as physical distancing rules are followed. Hairdressers and other beauty services are allowed to operate subject to varied restrictions. Intrastate travels are generally unrestricted except for travel to hotspot areas, but different interstate travel policies persist. Queensland and Western Australia still have their border closed, but no border restrictions remain in the Australian Capital Territory. Libraries, gyms, and retail shopping for non-essential items have reopened in most states. All students have physically returned to school.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The daily increase of cases in Australia has stayed at a very low level for weeks, while most new infections are imported and where people were placed under quarantine upon arrival. At least two cases have been confirmed in people who attended mass protests inspired by George Floyd, so health authorities urge people to stay vigilant. The government is considering shortening the quarantine time period for international students and business travellers, as well as for other travellers from countries with low rates of Covid-19 infection, such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea. States have accelerated lifting their restrictions. Most businesses and services have resumed with physical distancing and hygiene measures. Businesses in most states are allowed to accommodate between 50 and 100 customers by next week while up to 20 people can gather at homes. The prime minister announced on June 12 that when states move to the third stage of their COVD-19 reopening plan, stadiums with capacities of 40,000 or less will be able to seat 25% of their capacity. All students have physically returned to school. More states are now easing their border restrictions, while 3 states have already lifted controls completely. Interstate travels are expected to be possible nationwide in mid-July. The federal government is adding pressure to the states by raising court challenges against their border control. Meanwhile, the Australian Tourism Minister has said that national borders are likely to stay closed until 2021.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia has managed to maintain a low level of case increases with new infections emerging in only two states. On June 8, the country also recorded zero new locally acquired cases for the first time since the pandemic’s peak. Most of the increases in cases are imported now. An estimated $131.4 billion will be invested in public hospitals over the next five years as additional funding to strengthen the capacity of the health system and enhance national coordination. In terms of the protests inspired by the death of George Floyd, large rallies were held at multiple locations despite concerns and warnings from health authorities. States and territories are proceeding in their reopening plans at varied paces. Most states set their maximum number of people attending gatherings at either 10 or 20 people, which is expected to increase in the following weeks. Businesses continue to operate with limited capacity. As of June 9, all students would have physically returned to school. Intrastate travel is now unlimited everywhere. While interstate borders have mostly been opened, Queensland is determined to keep its borders closed to other states. The ban on most international cruise ships has been extended until mid-September. Borders will remain closed to foreigners for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia manages to maintain a low level of case increases, with some states seeing no new cases for weeks. Testing remains high, with 30,000 Australians being tested daily. $66 million from the Medical Research Future Fund will be invested mainly into vaccine and treatment development for COVID-19. The easing plan is being carried out across states and territories at varied paces. Most businesses have been reopening with physical distancing, hygiene and COVID-Safe work plans. The maximum number of people attending gatherings has been adopted in at least 20 states. This limit also applies to most businesses including hospitality, gyms, museums and shopping centers. The National Rugby League season returned on May 29 without spectators. Most states have lifted border restrictions, but travelling rules regarding quarantine still differ. Holiday homes are allowed to open depending on density and hygiene rules determined by states. Guidelines have been released to help return the film and TV industries to work for both domestic and international production companies. The reopening of schools continues gradually in the most affected states, while other states have fully reopened.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia’s government has continued easing restrictions related to COVID-19 after seeing the growth factor of the disease below 1 for the past two weeks. From June 15Australian residents will be allowed to travel to Northern Territory - which currently has 0 active cases - without mandatory hotel quarantine. Australia's first human trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine have begun in Melbourne with about 130 participants between 18 and 59 years old. Most states in Australia are expected to increase the number of people allowed to attend gatherings to 20 participants by the start of June. Beauty salons are being allowed to reopen, and catering establishments are being allowed to operate at higher capacity. Domestic tourism has resumed, and will be fully reopened by mid-June. Interstate borders have been fully lifted, with the exception of Queensland. Victoria allowed primary school students in grades 1 and 2, and high school students in their final year, to return to school on May 26, while 5 states have already resumed full-time schooling for all students.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia has seen limited growth in daily cases - under 20 on average for the past few weeks, with its Northern Territory declaring itself COVID-free after its last confirmed patient recovered. Meanwhile, people are still being urged to stay vigilant by practising physical distancing and good hygiene, and using contact tracing apps. The National Cabinet has approved the staged reopening of elective surgeries starting at 50% capacity. Australia’s states are proceeding with their own respective reopening plans at different paces - but cafes and restaurants have resumed conditional operation in most states. The reopening of shops is still in progress. The number of people attending gatherings has been capped at 10. Most states are expected to further ease their restrictive measures in the coming two weeks.</p>
