  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Few community cases have been recorded across Australia in recent weeks. Interstate border restrictions against New South Wales and Queensland are being gradually eased. COVID-related restrictions are also being relaxed in some states. The restrictions have gone back to the same level for the entirety of Queensland effective January 22: gatherings are capped at 50 people at homes and 100 in public spaces; up to 200 people can attend a wedding; a maximum of 500 people are allowed at indoor events and 1,500 outdoors; the one person per 2 square metre density requirement applies to all indoor facilities while open-air venues can return to full capacity; all hospitality venues have to collect contact information electronically. Starting January 22 in South Australia, the cap on private gatherings is raised from 50 to 200. That cap in Victoria is raised from 15 to 30 starting January 23. A negative PCR test conducted within 72 hours prior to departure is required from international travellers effective January 22. Masks are now mandatory on all international flights. The Pfizer vaccine has become the first approved COVID-19 vaccine in Australia.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Few locally acquired cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Australia over the past week despite sporadic outbreaks. Interstate border controls are still in place for New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria due to recently recorded local outbreaks there. Meanwhile, Victoria has adopted a new system that requires permits from all interstate travellers and allows travel from “green zones” and “orange zones” only. The international arrival regime is also changing: the number of arrivals into New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia will be halved, while the Northern Territory will admit more returning travellers.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A new outbreak in New South Wales has interrupted the reopening process in Australia. A localized lockdown has been placed on the Northern Beaches area from December 19 to December 23. Residents are asked to stay home and not travel out of the area; no entrance to the area is permitted without a valid reason. Hospitality venues will close except for takeaway services, and gyms, places of worship and function centres will close. Local residents are strongly advised to wear a mask while indoors. The premier of New South Wales has urged residents of Sydney to increase their mask wearing. Further restrictions have also been introduced for residents of Greater Sydney from December 21. No more than 10 people are allowed to gather at private homes. Hospitality venues and places of worship will face stricter density requirements and a 300-person capacity limit. Residents are urged not to visit residential aged-care facilities, disability services or vulnerable people unless necessary. All other states except for South Australia have imposed new border restrictions on the Northern Beaches, Sydney, or New South Wales as a whole.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia has continued to record very few locally acquired cases of COVID-19 over the past week. Both Australia and New Zealand have been cautious over the rollout of vaccines despite their approval in the UK, US and Canada. South Australia eased a series of restrictions on December 14 after reaching zero active domestic cases. The maximum number of people at home gatherings was raised from 10 to 50 people, while 200 people may attend weddings or funerals -- up from 150. Patrons will be able to stand up while drinking at hospitality venues, cinemas can operate at increased capacity, and gyms are subject to less stringent density requirements. People are no longer urged to work from home, and masks will be voluntary except for high-risk groups or settings. Starting this week, the Northern Territory government will be removing patrols at its minor land border entry points.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Few locally acquired cases have been reported in Australia over the past week. New South Wales has been told to tighten its hotel quarantine measures after overseas travellers accidentally bypassed quarantine and boarded a domestic flight. South Australia and Victoria have started to admit international flights once again. The Victorian government will be introducing legislation on December 8 to charge all returning travellers a quarantine contribution fee. Officials in Victoria also announced further reopening. Starting December 7, households are able to have up to 30 visitors per day at their homes and outdoor gatherings can have up to 100 people. Capacity limits no longer apply, but density limits remain for weddings, funerals, religious gatherings, restaurants and businesses with less than 25 patrons. Nightclubs are only allowed to have a maximum of 50 people. Staff in both the private and the public sector will be returning to their offices on January 11. Masks will still be required in indoor shopping venues, in taxis, and on public transport.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Few locally acquired cases have been reported in Australia over the past week. With more than two weeks without new local transmissions, New South Wales has eased more of its restrictions. Starting December 1, private gatherings can have up to 50 people outdoors, and restaurants, bars and cafes with up to 200m of floor space will be subject to looser density requirements. The current work-from-home order will be lifted on December 14. The Victoria government is revamping its hotel quarantine system with international flights resuming next month. Under the revamped system, all staff will be exclusively recruited by the agency and residents in quarantine will no longer be allowed to leave their rooms. Victoria and South Australia are introducing entry logging apps using QR codes. Due to increased transmission at quarantine facilities, South Australia is appealing to the national government to require returning travellers to undergo testing prior to boarding. International flights into South Australia have been suspended due to the local outbreak. The first cohort of international students to enter Australia since March arrived in Darwin, Northern Territory on November 30. The Queensland border has reopened to Victoria and the Greater Sydney area.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Most Australian states have eliminated, or nearly eliminated, community transmission of COVID-19. Due to fears of an outbreak sparked by the misreporting of a locally acquired case, South Australia went into lockdown between November 19 and November 22. Restrictions later returned to what they were earlier in the week following the lockdown. New South Wales announced further reopening this week. Starting on November 23, up to 3,000 people were allowed to gather for outdoor ticketed events and up to 500 for outdoor church services -- subject to social distancing regulations. The border between New South Wales and Victoria reopened on November 23 after a four-month closure.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After a cluster of locally acquired cases were reported in Adelaide over the past weekend, the South Australian government has reintroduced a series of restrictions from November 17: private gatherings are capped at 10 people per residence and 50 people at licensed venues, while pubs, clubs and restaurants can accommodate up to 100 patrons. Gyms are closed, community sports are cancelled, and personal care service providers are required to wear a mask. Masks are also mandatory for long-term care facilities, with visitors capped at two per day. All inbound international flights to Adelaide have been cancelled. Almost all the other states have reintroduced border restrictions targeting South Australia, jeopardizing the national agreement aimed at reopening all domestic borders by Christmas. A number of restrictions will be eased in Queensland on November 17: the gathering limit will be raised to 50 people and capacity limits will be raised at multiple venues. The federal vaccine strategy has been released; it includes a national system to monitor immunization levels and individual vaccination status.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia reported almost no new locally acquired cases this week. Victoria has been recording no new cases or new deaths for more than a week. Residents of Melbourne are allowed to move beyond 25 km from home and enter regional Victoria as of November 9. State-level restrictions now apply equally across Victoria: hospitality venues may seat 70 people outdoors or 40 indoors, gyms and fitness studios can reopen for up to 20 people, religious gatherings and funerals can have 50 people outdoors or 20 indoors, non-contact indoor youth sports can resume, and indoor pools can operate with up to 20 swimmers at a time. The Victorian government is working on a plan to accept international flights. The gathering limit in the Australian Capital Territory was raised to 500 people (from 200), and customers no longer have to be seated while eating and drinking as of November 13. The Australian government announced a $1.5 billion investment in two potential COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Novavax -- giving it 4 candidates to choose from.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia has reported limited numbers of community cases in recent days. The situation in Victoria is highly promising, with zero new cases in the past several days. All retail businesses will resume, and hospitality venues will be allowed to seat patrons again, subject to density limits. The mandatory mask policy is set to remain in place until at least the end of the year. In order to bring the Northern Territory in line with other jurisdictions, the government has announced enhanced contact tracing regulations that will come into effect on November 30. Hundreds of venues will be required to record the names, phone numbers and time of entry of the people who visit and stay for more than 15 minutes. Businesses have to review and update their COVID-19 safety plans every six months, which will be overseen by Òan in-house COVID safety supervisor.Ó</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia continues to report a low level of daily new cases, with promising trends within the border. Victoria reported 0 new cases on October 26 for the first time since June. High school students in Victoria returned to the classroom on October 26. In-person education in the state is now fully restored. New South Wales raised its outdoor gathering limit to 30 people and allowed restaurants to book groups of up to 30 from October 23. The prime minister is pressuring state and territory officials to further raise their limit on international arrivals to allow Australians stranded overseas to return. The Australian Capital Territory and South Australia have joined the state-by-state travel bubble to admit arrivals from New Zealand. However, internal travel controls have not been implemented to prevent New Zealanders from entering states that have not yet joined the travel bubble.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia continues to report a low level of daily new cases. An omnibus bill on COVID-19 passed in Victoria, extending the state of emergency until next April and authorizing police to enforce pandemic-related measures. Further reopening has been announced in Melbourne, which allows people to travel up to 25 kilometers from home as long as they remain within city limits, scraps the time limit on exercise and socializing outdoors, reopens hairdressers and resumes real estate auctions. Other states have also been easing their restrictions gradually. In Queensland, the private and public gathering limit was raised to 40 people, up to the same number may dance at weddings, and long-term care facility residents may go on excursions from October 16. In New South Wales, the limit for gatherings at outdoor public spaces and group bookings at restaurants will be increased to 30 people on October 23. Starting December 1, a maximum of 300 people will be allowed to attend weddings, subject to limits on density.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia continues to report a low level of daily new cases. In Victoria, a mass COVID-19 surveillance program started last week that targets asymptomatic employees at high-risk workplaces using saliva testing. The epidemiological situation in Melbourne continues to improve, but the reopening process will not be accelerated. Therefore, no significant reopening is expected within the next two weeks. At the federal level, the 2020 Federal Budget was introduced with the assumption that all domestic border restrictions would be lifted by the end of the year, except for West Australia. Incoming and outgoing international travel was not forecasted to bounce back even during next year.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in Australia has dropped to just above 10 in recent days. The situation in Victoria has also improved, and the state is returning to in-person learning at schools in a staggered process, with Year 7 students going back to classrooms on October 12 and Years 8, 9 and 10, returning on October 26. The government of South Australia permits people to drink while standing outdoors in licensed venues, and dance at private functions such as weddings. In Queensland, drinking while standing is also allowed from October 2, and on November 1, up to 40 people can gather in private and public spaces. After multiple delays, the Ôtravel bubble,Õ consisting of Australia and New Zealand, is going into effect; Australia will begin admitting travelers from New Zealand without a quarantine requirement on October 16, as long as they have not been in a designated COVID-19 hotspot in the preceding 14 days. New South Wales and the Northern Territory will be the first two states to reopen their international borders.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There have been very few new locally acquired cases outside the state of Victoria. The Victorian Aged Care Response Centre is now shifting its focus to prevention and recovery, signalling a significant improvement in the situation. After a grace period of two weeks, Victorians are again required to wear a mask in public. Four rapid antigen COVID-19 tests that can deliver results in 15 minutes have been approved by AustraliaÕs drugs regulator as a supplement to traditional tests. The federal government has signed onto the COVAX vaccine pool scheme. As the situation in Melbourne improves, officials have eased some restrictions, including the revocation of a curfew and the elimination of limits on how many people from a single household can go shopping at once. Starting September 28, a maximum of 5 people from 2 different households are allowed to gather outdoors, but the 5-kilometre limit from home still applies. Restaurants and other hospitality venues are only allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services, and most retail is still closed. Outdoor exercise with a personal trainer is permitted, as are other forms of exercise that do not involve a facility. From September 27, many industries have started a partial return to work if they have a COVID-safe plan in place. All primary school and specialist school students will resume in-person learning on October 12. Permits will not be required for childcare. Some states have started to relax their interstate border restrictions to admit travellers not coming from the designated ÒhotspotsÓ, such as Victoria and some parts of New South Wales and Queensland. Quarantine rules still vary from state to state. New South Wales and Queensland also relaxed some of their restrictive measures last week.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia is returning to limited levels of daily new cases, with Victoria reducing its case numbers faster than what was predicted by modelling. The Northern Territory has clinically eradicated COVID-19. Some of the restrictions will be relaxed in Melbourne as early as September 28 if it is able to get to a lower level of new infections. Regionally, Victoria has managed to progress to the next step of it roadmap. There will no longer be restrictions on leaving home. The gathering limit in the state was expanded to allow groups of up to 10 people outdoors. Residents of Victoria may create a social bubble with one additional household. Masks remain mandatory and there will still be tight restrictions on the number of people who visit other’s homes. Eateries are now able to offer table service subject to capacity limits. Up to 10 people are allowed to dine inside cafes and restaurants, and up to 50 people in outdoor areas. All shops and markets can open. Services involving close contact, including hairdressers, are allowed to resume if mask wearing is enforced. Every business across Victoria will be required to have a COVID-safe plan, which will be enforced from September 28. Travelling around the state is permitted for all residents outside Melbourne. The loosening of restrictions in Victoria will coincide with more police checkpoints and tougher questioning of those trying to enter the rest of the state from Melbourne. Outdoor contact and non-contact sports for children are also allowed, but only non-contact sports are permitted for adults. Both groups are subject to caps on the number of participants, depending on the type of sport. Accommodations will reopen in time for the school holidays and students in regional Victoria will return to the classroom in the fourth term of the year.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia has experienced a promising few days in its fight against a resurgence of COVID-19. The level of daily new infections in the state of Victoria has dropped to around 100 in recent days. The positivity rate of testing has fallen below 1%. Due to fears of another resurgence, Victoria revealed its roadmap to easing restrictions -- which is dependent on a daily average of 30 to 50 new cases in the state by September 28. Stage 4 restrictions will be extended for another two weeks in Melbourne, with some modifications. All the states and territories aside from Western Australia have come to an agreement to negotiate a uniform definition of COVID-19 hotspots and open up interstate borders by December. However, Western Australia did agree with another plan to boost the number of international arrivals allowed into the country. An agreement has been reached between the Australian government and pharmaceutical companies to provide more than 84.8 million vaccine doses -- almost entirely manufactured in Melbourne -- for the Australian population. Early access will be available by February 2021, if trials are successful. With the improvement in the national situation, states have again started to gradually relax their restrictions at varied paces. Victoria parents can now spend one hour a day outside with their children in addition to one-hour exercising. South Australia eased gathering restrictions on weddings and funerals, eating and drinking at bars, and football attendance from September 5. Employees are also being encouraged to return to their workplaces if safe to do so.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia has experienced a marked decrease in daily new infections and active cases over the past week. Victoria remains the epicentre and its state of emergency has been extended until September 13. In New South Wales, authorities are now concerned about cases with untraceable origins. The National Cabinet has agreed to release a weekly dataset on the common operating picture of COVID-19 responses across states and territories. The federal government will invest an additional $171.5 million in aged care support programs and $25 million in clinical trials for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. An agreement has been signed with AstraZeneca to secure a potential vaccine. If the vaccine clears trials, the government would manufacture it and make it free for all Australians. According to the health minister, those who refuse vaccination could lose access to some welfare payments. Queensland is stockpiling more than 120 million pieces of personal protective equipment. States and territories have not yet relaxed their interstate border restrictions. The New South Wales Chief Health Officer has tightened the restrictions around community sport for the next six weeks. Zone, regional, and state championships, as well as state-based competitions, are banned. Activities other than the competition itself--such as award ceremonies--will not be allowed.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia continues to battle a second wave in its southeast, with more than 7,000 active cases in Victoria and smaller clusters in New South Wales. Financial assistance for people’s self-isolating after the test will be increased from $300 to $450. The Victorian government is taking over the operation of private aged care homes which are of concern. The Prime Minister has apologized for failures in the aged care sector--most of the country’s COVID-19 deaths linked to aged care. The South Australian Government will ban aged care workers from working in multiple facilities effective August 27. The New South Wales Premier reiterated that extracurricular school activities should not take place. States and territories are maintaining strict control over their borders. For at least another 18 months, the Northern Territory will require travellers from COVID-19 hotspots to undertake a mandatory hotel quarantine at their own cost. Meanwhile, South Australia is preparing to welcome the country’s first group of about 300 international students back to their universities. The students are expected to land in September and undertake hotel quarantine paid for by their schools.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Except for a spike on August 6, the number of daily new infections in Australia has hovered around 400 over the past week. There are more than 7,000 active coronavirus cases in Victoria, the worst affected state, with a significant portion of them related to community transmission. The Victoria government has launched an in-home testing program for people who cannot easily travel to testing sites. The program could serve about 200 people every day. Door-to-door checks to ensure that stay-at-home orders are being followed will be expanded and, by this week, 4,000 household visits by authorities are expected every day. While Victoria and New South Wales continue with their restrictive measures, the other states are weighing their pace of reopening with more caution. Further stage 4 shutdown regulations have taken effect across Melbourne from August 6. Employees will be required to carry a permit when travelling to and from their workplace. Private construction for buildings taller than three storeys should be reduced to 25% of their operations, and smaller residential work is limited to five staff on site at any time. Supermarket and warehouse distribution centres that deal with medical equipment and pharmaceuticals have been given extra time to comply with restrictions that would force them to reduce their workforces. The police will continue to monitor the border of metropolitan Melbourne to ensure that travel to other parts of Victoria only happens for permitted reasons. Non-urgent elective surgeries in regional Victoria will be put on hold until further notice. Further relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in Western Australia has been delayed again due to the outbreak in Victoria. On August 10, the Australian Capital Territory reopens food courts, gaming, steam rooms and saunas--with the same social distancing rule and public gathering cap at 100 people.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia is grappling with a major outbreak in Victoria, as well as sporadic transmission in other states. Victoria recorded 723 new infections on August 1, breaking its previous record. Halfway through Victoria's six-week lockdown, the Premier announced tougher penalties for people who fail to self-isolate when required. People instructed to self-isolate will no longer be allowed to go out for exercise. This comes after more than 800 out of 3,000 people who were supposed to be self-isolating were found not at home during doorknocks conducted by officials. It was announced on July 28 that elective surgeries at all hospitals in Melbourne and Mitchell Shire would be postponed, except for the most urgent procedures. Personnel have been sent into the long term care homes overwhelmed by the outbreaks and infected residents are being transferred to hospitals to receive better care. The progress in reopening has been halted across the country and greatly reversed in hard-hit Victoria. The following stricter lockdown rules have been introduced in Victoria. From August 2, Melbourne has come under stage four restrictions where people are only allowed to go out for essential purposes within five kilometres of their home. A curfew will apply from 8 pm to 5 am each night. Most businesses and services have been either suspended or limited to essential services only. Residents are not allowed to have visitors in their home, but couples will still be allowed to visit each other. All students will return to remote learning. Public transport will be operating at reduced capacity. Starting August 6, regional Victoria will return to stage three restrictions. This means that restaurants and cafes will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery service and beauty and personal care services will need to close. Around the country, a national code has been adopted that long term care residents should not host more than two visitors at any time and visitors cannot mingle in common spaces. The federal and Victorian governments are currently working with the long term care sector on an arrangement where staff will only work at a single facility; the governments will compensate these staff for lost benefits.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia reported 502 new cases on July 22, its largest daily increase since the pandemic began. The recent outbreaks in Victoria among health workers and residents in long-term care facilities have raised concerns among public health officials. Victoria has extended its state of emergency until August 16. On July 23, it became mandatory for residents in Melbourne and its suburbs to wear face coverings in public. Despite calls for a complete regional lockdown, the Victoria government does not anticipate locking down any further. All those who self-isolate after being tested are eligible for a $300 payment. Despite the second lockdown of the region, data collected shows that residents of Melbourne are not limiting their movement. The federal and Victorian governments have agreed to set up a response centre to coordinate efforts. Paramedic students, retired healthcare workers and the military are now all being used to fight Victoria's surge in cases. New South Wales has reintroduced some restrictions on public gatherings and the number of patrons allowed in certain venues, including restaurants. Queensland reintroduced physical distancing requirements on July 24, forcing patrons to sit at bars, restaurants and hotels (unless ordering a drink). The National Capital Territory is not going to consider any further reopening until at least August 6. The National Cabinet has agreed to protocols that will allow freight to move across state borders, and to allow states and territories to enforce the new guidelines.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Aside from the outbreak in Victoria, New South Wales has also seen an increase in new infections. Victoria recorded a record-high of 317 new cases on July 16. Most elective surgeries have been suspended across Melbourne’s public hospitals as a growing number of healthcare workers have been infected, forcing many to self-isolate. Public hospitals will lower their elective surgery capacity to 50% to free up space, and private hospitals will drop to 75%. Nearly 1,000 military personnel will enter Victoria to assist by mid-August. Staff from some private enterprises will also join Victoria’s public health unit to do follow-up work, such as making and taking calls. No flights are now arriving in Melbourne. The reopening processes have been somewhat halted by the resurgence. New South Wales and Victoria allow for outdoor gatherings of up to 20 and 10 people, respectively. One hundred or more people can attend gatherings elsewhere. Interstate travel has been severely limited. All other states and territories have either imposed new interstate travel restrictions on Victoria and New South Wales or delayed their overall reopening schedule. Recreational sports may resume in most places in Australia.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia is still grappling with the resurgence of transmission in Victoria, its second largest state. Victoria has recorded more than 200 new cases per day multiple times in the past week and has overtaken New South Wales to become the worst-affected state in Australia. A six-week lockdown of metropolitan Melbourne and its suburbs started on July 9, covering more than 5 million people. Residents have to stay at home and any gatherings with more than 2 people are prohibited. Victorians have also been urged to wear masks when leaving home. The National Cabinet decided on July 10 to reduce weekly arrivals into Australia from about 6,500 to 4,000 to ease pressure on hotel quarantine. Airlines are reportedly prioritizing bookings for business passengers. The Cabinet also agreed to a national review of hotel quarantine arrangements, with states and territories moving toward a model of charging for hotel quarantine. The states and territories are moving on with their own reopening plans, with the exception of Victoria. Three states have completely scrapped the limit on the maximum number of people attending gatherings. Restaurants are able to accommodate large groups of patrons. Non-essential shopping has returned in most cases. Travelling within the state is largely unlimited. Although Victoria’s borders remain open to travellers from most of the other states, all other states are either banning Victorians from entering or taking strict measures against them.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Australia has experienced a sudden spike in the past week: its daily new infections approach 100. Victoria continues reporting double-digit new cases, with a significant portion of these from community transmission. The local outbreaks in Victoria are spreading to other states through interstate travellers. The Northern Territory recorded its first new case, who was previously released from quarantine in Victoria after 42 days with no active infection. A one-month stay-at-home order was put in place for 36 suburbs of Melbourne on July 2. The premier of Victoria has also expressed his intention to divert all international flights from Melbourne for two weeks. The recent outbreaks have mostly been related to extended family gatherings and failures of hotel quarantine management. Victoria is still ramping up its number of testing sites. Checkpoints have been set up by police officers in the COVID-19 hotspots to help enforce the localized lockdowns. The national Cabinet has agreed on a coordinated, cross-jurisdictional response to the local outbreaks, which will be based on cooperating on transmission surge management and enhancing public health capacity. Further testing will be conducted for those in hotel quarantine both at the beginning and in the last few days in quarantine. While the situation in Victoria has disrupted the reopening locally, the other states continue to ease their restrictions at varied paces. The federal government has said that, by the end of July, all states and territories will remove attendance caps for indoor venues if physical distancing is practised. Three states already scrapped the limit on the number of people for gatherings outdoors and at restaurants. Interstate borders will be mostly reopened by mid-July except to Victoria.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Even though Australia maintains a low level of new infections nationwide, Victoria, its second-largest state, has logged more than ten new cases per day for the past week, accounting for almost all the locally acquired cases. Victoria is extending its state of emergency until July 19. Six local government areas have been designated as outbreak hotspots, and so traveling to and from these areas is discouraged. These hotspots will be targeted with extra testing, pop-up clinics and “door-to-door” engagement from health officials. Responding to Victoria’s request, the Australian Defence Force will provide more than 1,000 personnel to help with the COVID-19 response. There are large variations between the pace of reopening in different states, but further relaxation is expected at the start of July. However, Victoria will be reversing part of its easing plan by reducing the maximum number of people at gatherings, events and businesses. While the least-affected states allow for 100 or more people at gatherings, only 10 to 20 are permitted in the most affected states. The maximum number of people at home gatherings ranges from 20 to unlimited. For restaurants, cafes and pubs the lowest capacity limits are 20 patrons; by contrast, the Northern Territory and Western Australia have scrapped capacity limits as long as physical distancing rules are followed. Hairdressers and other beauty services are allowed to operate subject to varied restrictions. Intrastate travels are generally unrestricted except for travel to hotspot areas, but different interstate travel policies persist. Queensland and Western Australia still have their border closed, but no border restrictions remain in the Australian Capital Territory. Libraries, gyms, and retail shopping for non-essential items have reopened in most states. All students have physically returned to school.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The daily increase of cases in Australia has stayed at a very low level for weeks, while most new infections are imported and where people were placed under quarantine upon arrival. At least two cases have been confirmed in people who attended mass protests inspired by George Floyd, so health authorities urge people to stay vigilant. The government is considering shortening the quarantine time period for international students and business travellers, as well as for other travellers from countries with low rates of Covid-19 infection, such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea. States have accelerated lifting their restrictions. Most businesses and services have resumed with physical distancing and hygiene measures. Businesses in most states are allowed to accommodate between 50 and 100 customers by next week while up to 20 people can gather at homes. The prime minister announced on June 12 that when states move to the third stage of their COVD-19 reopening plan, stadiums with capacities of 40,000 or less will be able to seat 25% of their capacity. All students have physically returned to school. More states are now easing their border restrictions, while 3 states have already lifted controls completely. Interstate travels are expected to be possible nationwide in mid-July. The federal government is adding pressure to the states by raising court challenges against their border control. Meanwhile, the Australian Tourism Minister has said that national borders are likely to stay closed until 2021.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
