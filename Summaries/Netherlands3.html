      Various sectors reopened as the Netherlands entered phase 2 of its reopening strategy on June 1. On that day, restaurants and bars reopened with a 1.5m distance rule, a capacity limit of 30 customers indoors with a pre-reservation system. While staff at restaurants were required to carry out temperature checks for all customers, the local officials of restaurants in four big cities disagreed to do so, unless under extenuating circumstances. Cinemas, theatres and concert halls reopened on a ticket-only basis with an audience capacity limit of 30 individuals, along with art music schools and museums, which reopened with pre-reservations and bookings along with social distancing measures to follow. Visits to nursing homes and other institutional care homes were also further relaxed from their previous restriction of 1 visit per person to now unlimited visits. On June 2, face masks became compulsory on public transport with a fine of up to €95 for non-compliance. COVID-19 testing became widely available to those even without a doctor’s referral, with the government urging individuals with a loss of smell or taste to get themselves tested as it is a prominent sign of the virus. Effective June 2, secondary schools and special education schools also reopened again with rotational shifts and preventive measures such as requiring pupils to walk or cycle to school unless their home distance from schools is far enough and is only commutable through public transport. However, pre-school, after school care and primary schools are scheduled to reopen in full capacity by June 8, after considering the successful reopening of partial primary schools.  Trade schools, colleges and universities are set to reopen for practical lessons and exams on June 15.
