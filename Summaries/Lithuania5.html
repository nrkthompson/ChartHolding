      The Lithuanian government ended a nationwide quarantine on June 16, but left the country in a state of emergency until further notice. This means that citizens and permanent residents of EU+ countries can now travel to Lithuania from countries where the incidence of COVID-19 has not surpassed 25 cases per 100,000 people in the last 14 days. On June 10, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Greece, Croatia and Cyprus were added to a list of countries which includes Germany, Latvia, Norway and Estonia from which international flights have been allowed to resume. Foreigners travelling to Lithuania from Belgium by land may now enter the country, provided that they self-isolate for at least 14 days upon arrival, while those travelling from Sweden, Portugal and the UK will remain prohibited from entering Lithuania until at least June 25. Lithuanian citizens and permanent residents can now return home from any of the aforementioned countries, subject to a 14-day isolation period upon arrival. Events and mass gatherings can take place in outdoor settings with up to 700 spectators and/or participants, while indoor events can take place with up to 150 participants. These limits are expected to increase to 1000 and 250 participants respectively by July 1.
