      Effective May 15, restaurants, bars, churches, and some museums have been allowed to reopen. The Austrian government has lifted some travel restrictions with Germany and Switzerland, resulting in the continuation of all travel between these countries, and the full reopening of borders by June 15. At the moment, residents of these countries are being allowed to cross the Austrian border after completing a self-declaration form. On May 18, elementary schools, lower grades in high schools, and special needs schools were reopened, while all other students will return to school on June 3. Students returning to school will operate under a shift system, with only half the class being present at all times to maintain social distancing measures. Large gatherings remain banned until at least August 31, and the Austrian government is still working on plans for theatres to resume while respecting social distancing rules. The Junior Minister for Culture stepped down after increasing pressure from theatre directors and performers over the lack of urgency in reopening cultural venues, even as the lockdown in Austria is eased. The resignation is critical to the left-wing Green party, who has been under fire for their limited role as a counterweight to their coalition partner,  Chancellor Kurz’s conservative party.
