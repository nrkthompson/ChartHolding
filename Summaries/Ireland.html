  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 17, 484 cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Ireland, with three more virus-related deaths. COVID-19 restrictions have been eased effective December 18--allowing up to three households to mix with each other. Previously, households were not allowed to mix unless they were already in a 'bubble'. People are also allowed to travel outside of the county that they live in under the new rules. The measures are due to be in place for three weeks. However, government ministers are likely to look at tightening restrictions again in late December.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">An additional 15 COVID-19 related deaths have been reported in Ireland, bringing the country's total death toll to 2,117. On December 11, 310 new cases were recorded. Also on December 11, Scotland's travel restrictions to and from most of Ireland were eased. The changes follow a reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases across most of the country -- excluding Donegal.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A total of 265 new cases were recorded on December 4, along with six additional deaths. A COVID-19 vaccination programme is likely to be rolled out across the country in the new year. Pfizer/BioNTech sought market authorisation for their COVID-19 vaccine on December 1 from the European Medical Agency (EMA). A vaccine can only be rolled out in a European Union country if it is approved by the EMA. The government said that the infrastructure to store the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at -70C is already being set up.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 27, 206 new COVID-19 cases were confirmed by the Department of Health. Ireland has agreed to ease restrictions from level 5 to level 3. This includes reopening all retail outlets, gyms, hairdressers, museums, cinemas, galleries, and libraries effective December 1. People will also be able to attend religious services and play golf and tennis again. However, they will not be allowed to leave the county -- except for essential purposes such as work, education, or a medical appointment. The 5 km travel limit will also be lifted, allowing people to travel freely within the county. Unlike typical level 3 restrictions, restaurants and cafes will not reopen until December 4. From December 18 until January 6, people will be allowed to travel to visit family and friends, but only three households can gather.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 20, 330 new cases of COVID-19 were reported -- for a total of 69,802 confirmed cases in Ireland since the start of the pandemic. The country has been under a six-week lockdown that began on October 21, with people being asked to stay at home and travel only for essential purposes. Despite pubs being closed and only takeaways permitted, concerns have been expressed about the number of people congregating to drink in various Irish city centres over the weekend. The Irish cabinet is expected to agree on new fines of less than 300 euros for people drinking alcohol outdoors, with licence holders facing a fine of up to 1,500 euros. Under licensing regulations, these drinks cannot be consumed within 100m of the premises that sold them.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 11, 270 new COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in Ireland. There has been a significant drop in infection rates over the past two weeks, which Ireland's chief medical officer described as "encouraging.” Ireland is in the middle of a six-week lockdown after the government imposed its highest level of COVID-19 restrictions on October 21.The government has discouraged Irish citizens abroad from booking flights back home during Christmas time. New travel rules come into effect on November 29 that will allow people arriving in Ireland from red listed regions to move freely around the country after receiving negative test results. The test must be taken five days after arriving in the Republic. The government also plans to bring the country in line with the EU's traffic light system in the upcoming days.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The R-rate of COVID-19 transmission in the Republic of Ireland has dropped below 1. The health minister said that the R- rate currently lies between 0.7 and 0.9. This comes two weeks after the Irish government imposed its toughest level 5 restrictions nationwide. The measures, broadly similar to the spring lockdown, are to be in place for six weeks but will be reviewed after four weeks. Ireland’s chief medical officer credited young people, ages 19-24, for the decline in COVID numbers -- saying that they have been very respectful of the measures in place by avoiding large gatherings in the form of parties and events.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 30, health officials have confirmed 772 new cases of COVID-19 and 6 new deaths in the Republic of Ireland. On November 2, schools will reopen as planned, despite a large cohort of secondary-school teachers threatening to go on strike. The government has said that they would do everything possible to support teachers and special-needs assistants to keep them safe in schools.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 21, 1,167 new COVID-19 cases have been reported in the Republic of Ireland. Following the continuous rise in cases, the Republic moved to its highest level of COVID-19 restrictions, effective October 21. The measures will be in place for 6 weeks, with review for any changes after 4 weeks. Under level 5 restrictions, people will be able to meet up outdoors with 1 other household away from their home. Social or family gatherings are not allowed in homes or gardens, but visits on compassionate grounds and for caring purposes can continue. Those living alone or parenting alone will be able to pair up with another household as part of a "support bubble". Many non-essential shops and hairdressers will close down, with bars and restaurants permitted to provide takeaway services. The number of wedding guests permitted will remain at 25, while up to 10 people will be allowed to attend funerals. Elite sporting events are permitted to take place and most manufacturing operations will also remain open.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 18, 1,283 new cases have been reported in the Republic, representing a new daily high for the state. On October 17, the national public health emergency team recommended that the country move to level 5 COVID-19 restrictions. Currently, most of the country is on level 3. However, three border counties, Donegal, Cavan, and Monaghan, moved to level 4 of the national framework on October 14. Under this level, weddings are limited to a maximum of 6 people; gyms, pools, leisure centres, and non-essential retail services closed down; and people are being encouraged to work from home. Government officials have not yet met to discuss whether the recommendations will be followed but there is speculation that a mix of level 4 and 5 measures will be adopted, with the exception of school closures.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 10, 1,012 new cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Effective midnight October 6 until October 27, the Republic will be placed under level 3 restrictions, contrary to the national public health team’s recommendation to move the country to level 5. Under level 3 restrictions, visitors to private homes and gardens are allowed a maximum number of six people from one other household. No social or family gatherings are allowed to take place, with the exception of weddings and funerals, where a maximum of 25 people are permitted. No indoor gatherings should take place, whereas outdoor gatherings are capped at 15. The public is advised to remain within the county, with the exception of those who must travel for essential purposes. All cafes and restaurants are permitted to offer takeaway or delivery and outdoor dining/service for up to 15 individuals. No sporting events are allowed, except for professional matches occurring behind closed doors. Schools, early learning centers, childcare services, and higher education institutions will remain open, with protective measures in place.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Irish government has been advised by the National Public Health Emergency Team to raise all 26 counties to level five, the strictest level of measures, for the next four weeks. In Dublin and Donegal, level three restrictions are currently in place, with the rest of the country at level two. At level five, visits between households are not permitted, only 10 people would be allowed to attend funeral services, weddings would be limited to 6 people, bars and restaurants would only provide takeaway, only essential retail shops would remain open, people would be asked to work from home, limit their exercise to within five kilometers of their home, and avoid public transport. Visits to care homes would be suspended except for in compassionate circumstances, however schools would stay completely open.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chief medical officers from the Republic have advised against all but necessary travel across the Northern Ireland-Donegal border following a rise in case numbers those areas. Level three restrictions have been set in County Donegal, effective September 26 until October 16. The rest of the country remains on level two restrictions, except Dublin, which was placed on level 3 on September 19 for three weeks. These restrictions include the ban of indoor gatherings, while outdoor gatherings are capped at 15 people. Religious services will be moved online with the exception of funerals and weddings, where only 25 people are allowed to attend. Wet pubs are allowed to stay open, but they will only be able to serve outdoors with at a cap of 15 people. Restaurants, cafes, and pubs that serve food are allowed to remain open for takeaway and delivery services, as well as outdoor dining for a maximum of 15 people. 6 visitors from one other household are permitted into a private home. People living in County Donegal are advised to remain in the county. The chief medical officers have expressed concern about the significant proportion of cases in young people in both Donegal and Derry. They appealed to teenagers and those in their 20s and 30s to reduce their social contacts.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 15, a Framework for Restrictive Measures was published that consists of 5 levels, with level 1 being the least restrictive. The Framework is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. The whole of Ireland is currently set at level 2. However, due to the rise in the number of cases in the capital city, the government placed Dublin at level 3, effective midnight September 18, for three weeks. Under level 3, the public has been encouraged to work from home where possible and only make essential journeys on public transport. Visitors to private homes and gardens are limited to 6 people. No indoor gatherings are allowed. Outdoor gatherings are capped at 15 people. Restaurants and pubs that had been serving food will only be allowed to cater outdoors or provide a take-away service. Outdoor dining should be limited to a maximum of 14 customers. Pubs in the rest of Ireland will be allowed to open on September 20, but nightclubs, discos and casinos in Dublin will remain closed. The number of people allowed to attend weddings and funerals will be restricted to 25 (down from 50), effective September 21. Sports training can continue, but only outdoors and in pods of up to 15. Gym classes are not permitted. Schools, creches and outdoor play areas remain open with restrictive measures in place. Effective September 20, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland will be added to Irelandís green list for travel. However, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, Greece, Norway and Estonia have been removed from the list.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ireland's wet pubs --bars that do not serve food -- are set to reopen on September 21. The plan is subject to local restrictions due to varied concerns over social distancing. Wet pubs have been closed since March, the longest closure of pubs in Europe. Under the new draft guidance, table service will be mandatory in all licensed premises and alcohol can only be served until 11:30 pm. The guidelines encourage a reduction of seating and two-metre social distancing between tables. This can be reduced to one metre if additional infection control steps are introduced. Customers will be limited to a 105-minute stay in premises where the one-metre measure is in operation. Only six people can be at any one table and they must not come from more than three households. Face coverings must be worn by staff who engage with customers, unless protective screens are in place.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ireland's cabinet reversed some of its lockdown relaxation measures in an attempt to deal with rising COVID-19 case numbers. The tightening of restrictions comes ahead of the reopening of schools over the next two weeks. The new restrictions will continue until September 13. They include a limit of 6 people at indoor gatherings (excluding shops, restaurants and other businesses) and a limit of 15 people at outdoor gatherings. Visits to homes should be limited to six people and involve no more than three households. People over 70 are encouraged to limit their interactions to a small network for short periods of time. All businesses are advised to facilitate remote working. Restaurants should be closed by 11:30 pm. Sports events should be held behind closed doors, with no social gatherings before or after. Public transport should be avoided where possible and face masks should be worn on private transport when households are mixed. GardaÌ (national police services) are to be given new powers to enforce the public health measures.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 17, the Irish governmentís advice against all non-essential foreign travel--regardless of whether or not a country is on the green list--remains in place. Options are being prepared by the government on how to restrict non-essential travel from countries outside the UK and EU, including the US. A proposed colour-coded warning system will be implemented soon. The model is expected to have yellow, orange, red and blue alert levels and is set to replace the current phased roadmap for altering lockdown restrictions. According to the Ministry of Health, the system could be required for another two years, depending on when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. The Ministry also warned that more localised lockdowns--such as those currently in place in counties Laois, Kildare and Offaly--may be required elsewhere in the country in response to future outbreaks. The yellow code reflects where most of the country is a present--with community transmission low and measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus. Orange would indicate an upsurge in cases, with a requirement for tighter infection control measures. The red code would be applied when a major outbreak occurs, such as the nationwide lockdown that was introduced at the beginning of the COVID-19 emergency. The blue status will be achieved when the virus is successfully suppressed in the country, or when a vaccine or effective treatment becomes available.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Recently, Ireland had recorded one of the lowest infection rates in Europe. However, last week COVID-19 cases surged--with the average infection rate doubling to more than 50 cases per day.  The three adjoining counties of Kildare, Laois and Offaly account for almost half of the new cases over the last two weeks. Ireland announced new restrictions for all three counties effective midnight, August 7, for a period of two weeks. Restaurants, cafes and pubs in the counties are allowed to serve food in outdoor areas to small groups for the next two weeks. Residents permitted to leave their county only in limited circumstances. Movement within the counties are also restricted--with the exception of work-related travel and other essential journeys. All kinds of indoor entertainment and sport venues, such as cinemas, theatres, museums, galleries and bingo halls, will close down for the period. Visits to prisons, acute hospitals and nursing homes will be suspended except on compassionate grounds.  Childcare and schools that are open will remain open, along with outdoor amenities including playgrounds--with social distancing measures in place. Retail shops can remain open with the compulsory application of face masks. Households in these counties are asked to restrict visitors to their homes to no more than 6 people from no more than 3  households. Outdoor gatherings are also limited to 15 people for organised activities.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 1, the Irish health department issued a warning to ensure gatherings are a maximum of 10 people indoors, with additional advice to avoid house parties. Restaurants are directed to enforce a limit of 50 people (including staff) on their premises at any time, ensuring all procedures and protocols are being followed. Environments where safety measures are not in place should be avoided. Effective August 3, random testing is taking place at airports in response to the increasingly volatile international situation.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 22, the Republic of Ireland released a "green list" of 15 countries, excluding the UK and the US, where travellers will be able to visit without the need to self-isolate upon their return. The list is reviewed biweekly for any changes in COVID-19 cases. At present, travellers arriving in Ireland from anywhere other than Northern Ireland are required to self-isolate or quarantine for 2 weeks. Plans for random testing at airports are set to be put in place in the coming weeks for people coming from non-green list countries. On July 23, the government announced a plan to launch a new initiative to encourage people to book stay-cations rather than holidaying abroad this summer. People will get money back money for holidaying in Ireland in the form of a tax credit or rebate. Domestic holidaymakers will receive Ä125 back if they spend roughly Ä600 on accommodation and restaurant bills. Couples will be able to claim as much as Ä250 back. The initiative is set to run until October this year and will apply to hotels, restaurants and non-alcoholic drinks. On July 27, the government announced its plan to fully reopen schools by the end of August with extra teachers, extensive cleaning regimes and personal protective equipment in place.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 15, Ireland announced their decision to not move forward to Phase 4 of their deconfinement strategyóamid concerns regarding an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in private households, particularly during the last week. With the current public health measures in place, the government has identified five key priorities for the upcoming weeks.  These include the compulsory application of face coverings in all retail settings and shopping centres, with the retail staff required to wear masks unless there is a partition in place or a space of 2 metres between them and the customers. Pubs, bars, hotel bars, nightclubs and casinos, which were due to reopen on July 20, will remain closed until August 10. However, those currently serving food can remain open. Social visits to peopleís homes would be limited to 10 people from no more than four different households. The current gathering restriction of 50 people indoors and 200 outdoors has been extended until August 10. The restriction on the size of crowds has made it difficult for cultural and arts facilities, such as theatres, cinemas and galleries, to open their doors. All non-essential travel is still discouraged.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ireland launched a contact-tracing app on July 6 to help track the spread of the virus and potentially limit its transmission. A similar app is scheduled to launch in Northern Ireland in the coming weeks, which will then allow apps on both sides of the border to exchange information. The app is currently only available to individuals whose smartphones have either iOS 13.5 or Android 6.0 and higher. The Irish government aims to publish a "green list" on 20 July, listing the countries safe for travellers. However, the advice against all non-essential travel from Ireland remains in place, along with the 14-day quarantine requirement for  people arriving in Ireland from overseas (this was previously set to be lifted by 10 July).  The government is also working on a major financial package to help schools reopen at full capacity in autumn, including extra funding for substitution cover, cleaning and support for school principals. However, there would be flexibility in the interim public health guidelines, with one-metre physical distancing rules eased for students.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ireland entered phase three of its deconfinement strategy on June 29, which included allowing travel anywhere within the country. Adult education centers, creches, childminding facilities, pre-schools, summer camps, youth clubs and all indoor and outdoor amenities for children reopened, with the provision of services to be carried out under strict physical distancing measures. Several retail stores reopened, including wellbeing services. Bookies, pubs and hotel bars operating as restaurants reopened at full capacity, along with hotels, hostels, caravan parks and holiday parks. Religious and cultural venues such as cinemas and music venues (but not nightclubs) reopened. Indoor gatherings are only permitted up to 50 people; outdoor gatherings are capped at 200 people. Sport related activities resumed, including team leagues for adults and children. Gyms, exercise facilities and public swimming pools were also given a go-ahead to open up again. Public transport capacity remains restricted; face coverings are compulsory if travelling by bus, taxi or train. In terms of international travel, all passengers arriving from outside Ireland are expected to self-isolate for 14 days and complete a passenger locator form. Ireland is not part of the EU deal that permits travel from 15 countries effective July 1. On July 3, the UK also excluded Ireland from its list of 59 countries from which travelers are no longer required to quarantine upon arrival in the UK effective July 10.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ireland's health authority has planned to launch a COVID-19 contact-tracing app based on Apple and Google's technology by the end of the month. With phase three of reopening scheduled to begin on June 29, domestic travel will be permitted anywhere within the country. Under this phase, pre-schools, summer camps, youth clubs and all indoor and outdoor amenities for children are scheduled to reopen, with the provision of services to be carried out under strict social distancing measures. Work from home for businesses will still be encouraged; however, several retail stores may reopen, including wellbeing services such as chiropractic and massage therapy, hairdressers, barbers, beauty salons, spas, tattoo and piercing parlors. Pubs and hotel bars operating as restaurants, cafÈs, hotels, hostels, caravan parks and holiday parks will also reopen at full capacity. Indoor gatherings of up to 50 people and outdoor gatherings of up to 200 will be allowed. Sport related activities, gyms, exercise facilities and public swimming pools will also reopen. People using public transport will be advised to wear face coverings and avoid peak hours unless they are an essential worker. In terms of international travel, all non-essential overseas travel is still discouraged. The Aviation Recovery Taskforce has advised the government to lift the 14-day compulsory quarantine for people arriving into Ireland by July 1, considering Irelandís lag behind other EU member states in restoring air travel.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, all shopping centres reopened with strict social distancing measures in place, including the closure of dining and seating areas around the stores to lessen dwell time among shoppers and discourage browsing for longer periods of time. To enforce social distancing with the stores, only a certain number of customers are allowed inside. Visits to nursing homes and residential care facilities are also allowed with pre-reservations of half an hour and a compulsory application of mask and gloves. Despite masks not deemed mandatory, people have been advised to wear them on public transport, in enclosed spaces and when visiting older people. Creches, pre-schools, hotels, restaurants and bars which provide table service, are scheduled to reopen within phase three of the relaxation strategy, effective June 29.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 5, the government announced their plan to fast-track its reopening strategy by reducing the number of phases to four, from the  initially scheduled five-phase plan. As  Ireland entered the second phase of its reopening strategy on June 8, a number of restrictions were lifted, including an allowance of up to six people to visit a household and meet outdoors for a short period of time, while maintaining strict social distancing rules. All high street shops resumed their businesses, while enforcing social distancing rules and staggered opening times to avoid unnecessary crowds. However all units in the shopping malls are to reopen next week with a restriction on gathering around benches or fountains. Libraries also began a phased reopening along with marts without spectators. Travelling of up to 20km away from home is allowed with the maintenance of social distancing measures and other guidelines in place.Gatherings at funerals and weddings of up to 25 people are extended from the previous set limit of 10. Groups of up to 15 people will be able to meet for outdoor sporting activities, with playgrounds fully reopening for kids. Creches, pre-schools, hotels, restaurants and bars which provide table service, are scheduled to reopen within phase three of the relaxation strategy, effective June 29.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With Ireland entering the second phase of its reopening strategy on June 8, a number of restrictions are planned to be lifted, including allowing four people to visit a household and meet outdoors for a short period of time, while maintaining strict social distancing rules. Small number of retail outlets with minimal staff are allowed to reopen, with limited capacity and a distance of 1.5m maintained between the customers. Travelling of up to 20km away from home is permitted with the maintenance of social distancing measures and other guidelines in place. Individuals aged 70 and above are allowed to exercise for a short period of time with retail hours coordinated across all retailers for them, with strict social distancing measures such as the provision of gloves and application of face coverings in place. Visits to homes of over 70s and the medically vulnerable are allowed by a small number of people for a short period of time, while wearing gloves, face coverings and maintaining a strict 2m physical distance. Creches and pre-schools also reopened, with primary and secondary schools scheduled to reopen in late August.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With no new COVID-19 related deaths reported in Ireland, the government announced their plan to move into the second phase of their deconfinement strategy will be decided by June 5th, after monitoring the situation for an additional week. The PM stated that the restrictions may lift more quickly than their designated date if the case numbers continue to decrease. The Irish Hairdressers Federation has announced the safe reopening of salons by the end of June, with a list of 110 guidelines based on official public health advice. The Federation is asking the government to allow them to reopen earlier on June 29th, rather than the current phase 4 date of July 20th. Face coverings for staff and clients would be made mandatory, along with extra hand washing, while customers would be seen by appointment only with no walk-ins allowed. Customers will not be served if they are running a temperature, or have been out of the country. On May 26th,  RyanAir, the low cost Irish airline, announced its plan to operate 40% of its flight schedule by July 1st, originating their trips from Northern European countries including UK, Belgium, Holland, Ireland, and Germany. The airline will also land at main airports in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain. The airline assures to operate its flights with new health measures in place, requiring all passengers and crew to wear masks at all times, whether it be at airport terminals or onboard the aircraft, following the advice set out by the EU.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 18th, Ireland entered the first stage of its  5 phase roadmap planned  by the government to reopen its economy. In phase 1, unnecessary travel is restricted to all residents, with advice to stay home except for a brief outdoor exercise within 5km of their homes. Golf and tennis courts are permitted to reopen with online booking and adherence to strict policies. For instance, tennis is not allowed to be played in a competitive nature with the presence of an audience, while golf is restricted to allow only three people to play together at once.. Also, people over 70 years of age are highly discouraged from participating in sports. Some construction firms resumed work with the reopening of garden centres and hardware stores. Firms and  workers are expected to comply with the measures set out in the Return to Work Safely Protocol, laid out by the government. The protocol includes a 2 metre distance rule on and off site, along with the application of mask and shield at all times. Other businesses including motor and bike repair shops, opticians, dry cleaners, and phone outlets will also resume work under the same safety procedures. Schools and college buildings reopened to allow teachers to organise remote learning. Some tourist amenities including car parks, beaches, and mountain walks reopened to encourage tourism in the country. With regards to gatherings, four people from different households are permitted to meet outdoors while observing the 2 metre distance rule, whereas funerals are restricted to a maximum of 10 people. The final stage of the roadmap will include plans for the reopening of pubs, effective August 10th.</p>
