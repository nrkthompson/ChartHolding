  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ireland launched a contact-tracing app on July 6 to help track the spread of the virus and potentially limit its transmission. A similar app is scheduled to launch in Northern Ireland in the coming weeks, which will then allow apps on both sides of the border to exchange information. The app is currently only available to individuals whose smartphones have either iOS 13.5 or Android 6.0 and higher. The Irish government aims to publish a "green list" on 20 July, listing the countries safe for travellers. However, the advice against all non-essential travel from Ireland remains in place, along with the 14-day quarantine requirement for  people arriving in Ireland from overseas (this was previously set to be lifted by 10 July).  The government is also working on a major financial package to help schools reopen at full capacity in autumn, including extra funding for substitution cover, cleaning and support for school principals. However, there would be flexibility in the interim public health guidelines, with one-metre physical distancing rules eased for students.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ireland entered phase three of its deconfinement strategy on June 29, which included allowing travel anywhere within the country. Adult education centers, creches, childminding facilities, pre-schools, summer camps, youth clubs and all indoor and outdoor amenities for children reopened, with the provision of services to be carried out under strict physical distancing measures. Several retail stores reopened, including wellbeing services. Bookies, pubs and hotel bars operating as restaurants reopened at full capacity, along with hotels, hostels, caravan parks and holiday parks. Religious and cultural venues such as cinemas and music venues (but not nightclubs) reopened. Indoor gatherings are only permitted up to 50 people; outdoor gatherings are capped at 200 people. Sport related activities resumed, including team leagues for adults and children. Gyms, exercise facilities and public swimming pools were also given a go-ahead to open up again. Public transport capacity remains restricted; face coverings are compulsory if travelling by bus, taxi or train. In terms of international travel, all passengers arriving from outside Ireland are expected to self-isolate for 14 days and complete a passenger locator form. Ireland is not part of the EU deal that permits travel from 15 countries effective July 1. On July 3, the UK also excluded Ireland from its list of 59 countries from which travelers are no longer required to quarantine upon arrival in the UK effective July 10.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ireland's health authority has planned to launch a COVID-19 contact-tracing app based on Apple and Google's technology by the end of the month. With phase three of reopening scheduled to begin on June 29, domestic travel will be permitted anywhere within the country. Under this phase, pre-schools, summer camps, youth clubs and all indoor and outdoor amenities for children are scheduled to reopen, with the provision of services to be carried out under strict social distancing measures.

In terms of international travel, all non-essential overseas travel is still discouraged. The Aviation Recovery Taskforce has advised the government to lift the 14-day compulsory quarantine for people arriving into Ireland by July 1, considering Ireland’s lag behind other EU member states in restoring air travel.</p>

The Irish Hairdressers Federation has announced the safe reopening of salons by the end of June, with a list of 110 guidelines based on official public health advice. The Federation is asking the government to allow them to reopen earlier on June 29th, rather than the current phase 4 date of July 20th. Face coverings for staff and clients would be made mandatory, along with extra hand washing, while customers would be seen by appointment only with no walk-ins allowed. Customers will not be served if they are running a temperature, or have been out of the country. On May 26th,  RyanAir, the low cost Irish airline, announced its plan to operate 40% of its flight schedule by July 1st, originating their trips from Northern European countries including UK, Belgium, Holland, Ireland, and Germany.

  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 18th, Ireland entered the first stage of its  5 phase roadmap planned  by the government to reopen its economy. In phase 1, unnecessary travel is restricted to all residents, with advice to stay home except for a brief outdoor exercise within 5km of their homes. Golf and tennis courts are permitted to reopen with online booking and adherence to strict policies. For instance, tennis is not allowed to be played in a competitive nature with the presence of an audience, while golf is restricted to allow only three people to play together at once.. Also, people over 70 years of age are highly discouraged from participating in sports. Some construction firms resumed work with the reopening of garden centres and hardware stores. Firms and  workers are expected to comply with the measures set out in the Return to Work Safely Protocol, laid out by the government. The protocol includes a 2 metre distance rule on and off site, along with the application of mask and shield at all times. Other businesses including motor and bike repair shops, opticians, dry cleaners, and phone outlets will also resume work under the same safety procedures. Schools and college buildings reopened to allow teachers to organise remote learning. Some tourist amenities including car parks, beaches, and mountain walks reopened to encourage tourism in the country. With regards to gatherings, four people from different households are permitted to meet outdoors while observing the 2 metre distance rule, whereas funerals are restricted to a maximum of 10 people.
