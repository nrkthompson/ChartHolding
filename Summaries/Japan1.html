      Japan’s government ended its state of emergency in another 3 regions on May 21, leaving only 5 areas - including Tokyo - under “Specific Cautions”. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on May 14, “a full-fledged start towards a new normal for everyday lives,” providing sanitary guidelines for over 80 industries - including hospitality, commerce, and public transportation.Apart from the areas still under Specific Cautions where people are asked to refrain from leaving home, businesses are requested to close, and events are not to be held, the local authorities can determine the progress of reopening without compulsory restrictions imposed by the national government.Despite the national government's requests, businesses are permitted to reopen, and large-scale events with up to 100 people indoors, and 200 outdoors, are being allowed.
