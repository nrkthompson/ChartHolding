      On June 9, the Office for National Statistics said that about 64,000 more people than usual have died in the UK during this year's pandemic, which surpasses the kingdom’s COVID-19 death toll of 52,000. According to Neil Ferguson, a senior scientist who was advising the government in March, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the UK could have been halved, if the government had introduced the lockdown one week earlier. PM Johnson is facing increased backlash due to Ferguson’s testimony. Additionally, the government’s unpopular two-week quarantine on international arrivals was established on June 8, with experts saying it’s too late and hence too ineffective, as it will devastate tourism. British Airways, along with  over 500 tourism and hospitality companies, have come together under the title “Quash Quarantine” and are deciding how best to combat the rules including potential legal action. According to an OECD report, Britain’s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the crisis out of all high-income countries with a projected slump in the UK’s national income of 11.5%. Although most sectors in the UK remain closed, non-essential retail outlets are expected to reopen on June 15, with a range of social distancing and protective measures. Johnson is planning to scrap the two metres distancing rule by September at the latest for schools to reopen fully for the start of the new school year.
