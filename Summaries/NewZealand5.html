      New Zealand ended its 24-day streak of zero new infections on June 16 after identifying two new cases from people who had been permitted to visit relatives who were on their deathbed. There is increasing concern about people returning from overseas and breaking quarantine rules. The contact tracing app has been upgraded to notify users about possible contact with confirmed cases. Hospitals have been busy dealing with postponed elective surgeries and increasing demand for normal emergency services. New Zealanders continue to enjoy their lives like normal while still being asked to stay vigilant. No legal requirements persist for businesses and services, but keeping entry logs by using QR codes is encouraged. Borders remain closed to foreign travellers and the opposition party has been urging the government to move faster in opening borders to tertiary international students, who make large contributions to New Zealand industries. The government granted entry last week to partners and dependents of New Zealand citizens and residents. Others with a compelling need will also be offered an entry exception.
