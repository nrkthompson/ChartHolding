  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Latvia’s Center for Disease Prevention and Control (SPKC) has revised and extended its list of countries from which travellers are required to undergo 14 days of self-isolation upon arrival in Latvia. 20 European countries – including Luxembourg, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands – have been added to Latvia’s “red” list.  The list includes countries with a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate of over 20 people per 100,000.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a proposal from Latvia’s Center for Disease Prevention and Control, the Latvian government decided to make COVID-19 testing mandatory for temporary international workers at the end of the first week of their work period. The new regulation stipulates that from July 28, temporary workers from “high-risk” countries must be tested for COVID-19 prior to starting work in Latvia, and again 5- 7 days after arriving in Latvia. The proposal and subsequent regulatory action came after Latvian health authorities confirmed that 5 temporary workers from Uzbekistan were infected with COVID-19 shortly before entering Latvia.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite reporting 13 new cases of COVID-19 on July 26, Latvian officials have stressed that the country’s COVID-19 epidemiological situation is “one of the most secure in the world.” Officials said that most of Latvia’s new infections have been brought to the country from abroad.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 15, Latvia’s Cabinet of Ministers adopted several decisions that will allow them to more effectively collect information on, and monitor the activity of, both Latvian residents and foreigners entering the country. From July 16, all passengers on international flights will have to submit a questionnaire to the Latvian National Police and the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, indicating any countries they have visited in the last 14 days, their contact information, and the address where they will undergo their 2-week isolation period. In addition to these measures, a regulatory framework was passed that will allow temporary residence permits and visas to be revoked for third-country nationals who violate self-isolation rules, along with a fine of up to 2000 euros. Latvia’s contact-tracing app reached 100,000 downloads on July 20.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 10, Latvia’s Cabinet decided to partially renew certain restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. Latvia’s Ministry of Health concluded that three separate outbreaks of the virus occurred in the past week, and that each one occurred in either a bar or restaurant. As a result, the Ministry of Health suggested that the Latvian government consider reintroducing certain restrictions on eateries. The decision of the Cabinet stipulates that, from July 11, eateries will not be allowed to operate between midnight and 6:30am, and no more than 4 people will be allowed to share a table indoors.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 30, Latvia’s cabinet decided to partially reduce certain measures restricting the spread of COVID-19--given the country’s favourable epidemiological situation with respect to the virus. Effective July 1, the use of face coverings on public transport is no longer mandatory, but is still strongly recommended. Up to 100 people may gather in indoor premises with an area less than 1000m, up to 500 people in larger premises, and up to 1000 people outdoors. In order to increase testing rates and detect potential outbreaks in a timely manner, all Latvian citizens and permanent residents have the opportunity to be tested for COVID-19 for free at given times throughout the week.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Latvia has not reported any new cases of COVID-19, or any deaths caused by the virus since June 20 and June 17, respectively. All Latvian residents are still required to cover their faces while using public transport, and are being encouraged to continue doing so in other public settings.</p>
