  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">There has been a rapid increase of COVID-19 infections in Latvia, reaching 55.63 cases per 100,000 residents as of October 13, in contrast to 31.25 per 100,000 last week. As a result, LatviaÕs Cabinet of Ministers has announced new restrictions to take effect during the week of October 12.

  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">LatviaÕs Director of the State Chancellery said on October 2 that restrictions on public gatherings are not currently being considered, despite a surge of new COVID-19 cases. When asked if the countryÕs current epidemiological situation could serve as a reason to implement new restrictions, the government said that there are no plans to do so at the moment, despite an emergency task-force meeting set to take place on October 5 to discuss the spread of COVID-19 in Latvia. On the same day, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (SPKC) increased its COVID-19 infection threshold so thatÊself-isolation will now be required when entering Latvia from countries with a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 incidence of 25 per 100,000,Êinstead ofÊthe previous 16. This means that only Finland, Cyprus, the Vatican, and Liechtenstein are currently on the so-called "white list" of countries not requiring compulsory self-isolation. From October 7 it will again be compulsory to wear protective face masks when using public transport services in Latvia, as ordered by the government.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">From September 28 onward, all travellers entering Latvia will be notified of self-isolation requirements via SMS text message upon entering the country. The message calls for mandatory self-isolation and other precautions in order to avoid exposing others to the risk of infection, including the following: individuals arriving from countries with a high incidence of COVID-19 must self-isolate for 10Êdays; while in self-isolation, new arrivals are not allowed to receive guests, visit others, or go to work and public places where many people may be present, with the exception of shopping for essentials. New arrivals must monitor their health conditions for 10Êdays and measure their body temperature throughout their isolation. If respiratory symptoms are developed, a doctor must be contacted in order to decide on whether or not they should be tested for COVID-19. A previously acquired negative COVID-19 test does not exempt travels from their obligation to self-isolate upon arriving in Latvia.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 15, the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers decided to reduce the self-isolation period required upon entering Latvia from 14 to 10 days. Medical staff, social care providers, and educational staff who are in close daily contact with patients, clients, or children, respectively, will only be allowed to follow the shorter, ten-day self-isolation period after leaving a so-called “red country” if they test negative for COVID-19 on the eighth day upon their arrival. Lithuanian and Estonian citizens, who were previously exempt from self-isolation requirements as part of the Baltic travel bubble, are now subject to the same requirements as other foreigners.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 2, the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers approved a number of changes to regulations governing the transport, education and health sectors. According to certain criteria, shipments to and from countries that have so far been included on Latvia’s list of “high-risk” countries will be allowed to resume, but international passenger services will not be available. On September 4, in response to an increase in COVID-19 cases in Lithuania and Estonia, Latvia’s Cabinet also made changes to the legal framework governing the mobility of persons between neighbouring countries. Considering the close integration between Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, the Latvian government exempted those persons who work, study or attend kindergarten on a daily basis in any of the aforementioned countries from mandatory 14-day self-isolation upon arrival. Persons accompanying a minor or an adult student with special needs shall also be exempted from self-isolation. In all the above-mentioned cases, travellers will be required to take precautions and use mouth and nose covers in public places. Travellers will be allowed to visit shops, but will not be allowed to receive guests and visit social and public places, as well as rooms with a large number of people -- with the exception of places of work.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 19, Latvia’s Ministry of Education and Science announced that it will wait until August 25 for each of the country’s schools to individually develop their own plans for the upcoming school year. Schools are expected to inform the ministry of how they plan to organize events associated with September 1 – the first day of school – and which of three organizational models they plan to implement throughout the school year. The first model entails an entirely in-class approach to teaching, the second provides for a mixture of in-person and online teaching, and the third provides for entirely virtual teaching. New laptops will be supplied to each public school by the end of 2020 in order to facilitate online learning.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Latvian government has continued easing restrictions related to COVID-19 this week, despite a series of contained outbreaks in recent weeks. As of August 17, up to 1000 people are permitted to gather indoors. The limit on outdoor gatherings remains at 3000. Restrictions previously reimposed on catering establishments following a series of outbreaks among restaurant customers have also been lifted--allowing up to eight people at one table indoors (up from 4). Catering establishments can now remain open until 2 am. Similar restrictions have been lifted for cultural establishments, sporting events, and religious services--which can all now remain open and provide services until 2 am.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Latvia’s Center for Disease Prevention and Control (SPKC) has revised and extended its list of countries from which travellers are required to undergo 14 days of self-isolation upon arrival in Latvia. 20 European countries – including Luxembourg, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands – have been added to Latvia’s “red” list.  The list includes countries with a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate of over 20 people per 100,000.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a proposal from Latvia’s Center for Disease Prevention and Control, the Latvian government decided to make COVID-19 testing mandatory for temporary international workers at the end of the first week of their work period. The new regulation stipulates that from July 28, temporary workers from “high-risk” countries must be tested for COVID-19 prior to starting work in Latvia, and again 5- 7 days after arriving in Latvia. The proposal and subsequent regulatory action came after Latvian health authorities confirmed that 5 temporary workers from Uzbekistan were infected with COVID-19 shortly before entering Latvia.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite reporting 13 new cases of COVID-19 on July 26, Latvian officials have stressed that the country’s COVID-19 epidemiological situation is “one of the most secure in the world.” Officials said that most of Latvia’s new infections have been brought to the country from abroad.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 15, Latvia’s Cabinet of Ministers adopted several decisions that will allow them to more effectively collect information on, and monitor the activity of, both Latvian residents and foreigners entering the country. From July 16, all passengers on international flights will have to submit a questionnaire to the Latvian National Police and the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, indicating any countries they have visited in the last 14 days, their contact information, and the address where they will undergo their 2-week isolation period. In addition to these measures, a regulatory framework was passed that will allow temporary residence permits and visas to be revoked for third-country nationals who violate self-isolation rules, along with a fine of up to 2000 euros. Latvia’s contact-tracing app reached 100,000 downloads on July 20.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 10, Latvia’s Cabinet decided to partially renew certain restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. Latvia’s Ministry of Health concluded that three separate outbreaks of the virus occurred in the past week, and that each one occurred in either a bar or restaurant. As a result, the Ministry of Health suggested that the Latvian government consider reintroducing certain restrictions on eateries. The decision of the Cabinet stipulates that, from July 11, eateries will not be allowed to operate between midnight and 6:30am, and no more than 4 people will be allowed to share a table indoors.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 30, Latvia’s cabinet decided to partially reduce certain measures restricting the spread of COVID-19--given the country’s favourable epidemiological situation with respect to the virus. Effective July 1, the use of face coverings on public transport is no longer mandatory, but is still strongly recommended. Up to 100 people may gather in indoor premises with an area less than 1000m, up to 500 people in larger premises, and up to 1000 people outdoors. In order to increase testing rates and detect potential outbreaks in a timely manner, all Latvian citizens and permanent residents have the opportunity to be tested for COVID-19 for free at given times throughout the week.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Latvia has not reported any new cases of COVID-19, or any deaths caused by the virus since June 20 and June 17, respectively.
