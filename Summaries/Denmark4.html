      Denmark lifted a number of restrictions this week as the country moves towards a full reopening of its economy. The gathering limit increased to 50 people, and fitness centres and swimming pools could reopen on June 8. Some events of up to 500 people may be allowed under an as-of-yet unreleased set of guidelines, including weddings and sports events. While these events may be permitted to occur, they must follow the guidelines set out for nightlife, meaning they must end by midnight and limit alcohol sales.131 Opposition parties railed against this policy, saying that the government was treating Danish citizens like children.132 The government later reached an agreement with opposition parties to raise the gathering limit to 100 people on July 8 and 200 people on August 8, however, there is no timeline for the other restrictions still in place.133 The government is advising that the 15,000 people who took part in an anti-racism protest in Copenhagen this week be tested for COVID-19 due to fears of a mass spread of the virus.134 PM Frederiksen has conceded that her decision to lockdown Denmark in March was largely political after facing criticism that she ignored the advice of public health officials in the early days of the crisis.135
