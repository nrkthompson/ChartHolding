      This week, the 4-day average reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Germany continues to decrease, standing at 0.86 on June 10, down from 0.89 reported last week.42 Germany has extended its travel advisory warning for Germans wishing to travel abroad until August 31, and Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is campaigning for the EU-wide travel ban for non-EU citizens to be extended until July 1.43 On June 11, Germany allowed 243 ill and under-age refugees from Greece to enter the country, for the first time since the pandemic began.44 Each state continues to open up unilaterally, based on federal suggestions regarding the R-naught variable.45 Larger stores, markets, malls and restaurants are open across the country. The remaining discrepancies between the states are largely tied to cultural and leisure activities, such as cinemas, museums and fitness centers.46 Within the next two weeks, these institutions should be more harmonized with their reopening. On June 10, Chancellor Merkel and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang met virtually to discuss the bilateral trade relations between the countries; Germany is advocating for a more liberated trade market with the Asian nation.47
