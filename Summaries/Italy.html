      This week, Italy is entering Phase 3 of its gradual unlocking strategy with nearly all businesses reopened. Cinemas and theatres have reopened, but no more than 200 people can attend events at indoor venues and there is a maximum of 1,000 attendees at outdoor events. This rule also applies to museums, art galleries and nightclubs. Online booking is required when visiting cultural sites and using contact services. On June 25, summer camps and kindergartens can reopen but classes will not resume for students until September. Despite reopening its borders to travellers from the EU and Schengen area, Italy has not guaranteed reopening to international tourists. Regional travel variation exists with arrivals from Rome and Naples being subject to temperature checks and COVID-19 testing at their airports. The prime minister, health minister and interior minister were questioned by prosecutors about the government’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak in an attempt to determine whether there are grounds for criminal negligence charges. Regional authorities and the central government are trading blame for the shortcomings of Italy’s COVID-19 response. The outcome of the investigation will be used as a political tool against the party blamed for the mismanagement. The division between parties is prevalent and has affected how the outbreak was handled,  despite hopes for collaboration earlier in the outbreak.

      In Bergamo, a province in northern Italy’s hardest hit Lombardy region, 57% of residents who had blood tests were found to have COVID-19 antibodies. The Italian government released a contact tracing app called Immuni, a voluntary app that uses Bluetooth technology to exchange information between users' phones. While the app can already be downloaded, it is being tested this week in four regions before being extended nationwide. The release of the app was delayed due to citizen resistance because of privacy concerns which has since been mitigated with assurances of anonymity. Despite criticism that 60% of the population must download the app for it to be effective, a poll showed that only 44% of citizens are likely to download the app. The app is intended to act as an early warning system for the virus in order to lower the risk of more serious consequences in the event of a second wave in the fall. Mayors in Florence and Venice are aiming to leverage the current crisis to shift towards emphasizing slow tourism within their cities. These cities intend to cater to tourists that stay in the city and experience the museums and restaurants, rather than to day-trip tourists in the future.

      On June 1, several cultural sites reopened including the Vatican Museums, the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa, under measures which include physical distancing, and temperature checks. On June 20, Italy’s Serie A soccer league will resume. Freedom of movement was restored on June 3 allowing Italians to travel freely in the country and EU visitors to enter without quarantine requirements. In response, regional governors are pressing for some ability to trace tourists or to test them to ensure that transmission is contained. In four of Italy’s twenty regions, contact tracing apps are currently being used to help the country avoid a second wave. Four weeks into the country’s easing plan, the number of cases continues to decline, resulting in some Italian doctors suggesting that “the virus no longer exists in Italy.” The Head of Milan’s San Raffaele Hospital urged the Italian government to continue lifting measures, arguing preparations for a second wave are creating unnecessary fear. However, the Health Minister said there is insufficient evidence to back up these claims and urged Italians to continue following guidelines. On Italy’s Republic Day, Orange Vest protests emerged across  regional capitals. Hundreds gathered to protest the government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis and to call for its resignation. In Rome, the parties making up the opposition held a joint rally against the government's policies. These protests defied government orders to maintain social distancing and to use masks in busy spaces.

      Effective June 3, Italian borders will reopen for travel to all citizens of the Schengen area without exceptions or quarantine; travel between regions will also be allowed. Italy will not open to international tourists yet but will likely filter high-risk countries based on pandemic trends and infection levels. Some hotels will reopen on June 1, depending on the number of bookings. Since May 25, gyms and swimming pools have reopened under strict hygiene and social distancing rules which include appointments, temperature checks, and the use of masks upon entering facilities. The Italian government is encouraging remote training and some regions have delayed this reopening phase until May 31. Sports teams are able to hold group training but competitive matches remain banned. The next phase is set to begin on June 3 but, Regional Affairs Minister, Francesco Boccia, said the government will not open up travel between Italian regions if mass social gatherings continue. Mayors across Italy have begun imposing new restrictions in response to crowds across the country as officials warn about the danger of a second wave of infections. The Italian government announced that 60,000 people could be employed to help enforce social distancing and the use of masks in public places but, this plan has been met with opposition.

      In its second phase of reopening, hospital networks across Italy have increased their number of beds and reduced the number of patients requiring intensive care, showing that the situation is currently sustainable for future phases. Italy will begin testing a representative sample of 150,000 people across 2,000 cities next week in order to understand the extent of COVID-19’s impact on the country. Restrictions on shops, eateries, and churches were eased on May 18, but social distancing measures will remain in effect. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to operate with a limited capacity, and no standing room will be available at the bar. There is widespread discontent among restaurant and bar owners with regard to the guidelines set by the national government, with many arguing that the rules are unclear, and that the sector requires more concrete help in order to stay open. On May 25, gyms, pools, and sport centres will be allowed to reopen. The Italian government plans to begin easing restrictions on movement, announcing on May 16 that all airports will be permitted to continue domestic and international travel by June 3.
