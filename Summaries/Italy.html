  <h5>February 1, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Italy, 14,360 new daily cases of COVID-19 infection were reported on January 29. Effective February 1, the current tiered system of restrictions remains in place with the majority of the country in the yellow zone. In yellow zones, eateries can stay open until 6 pm and takeaway services at restaurants are permitted until 10 pm. Museums can reopen during the week and hairdressers can resume services. High schools can begin teaching in person at 50-75% capacity. Across Italy, a nighttime curfew remains in effect from 10 pm to 5 am, while gyms, cinemas, theme parks, pools, and theatres remain closed. The ban on non-essential movement between regions will remain in effect until February 15. The country’s vaccination rollout has slowed, with the government blaming Pfizer for its delay in delivering new doses. On January 26, the PM resigned.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Italy, 14,055 new daily cases of COVID-19 infection were reported on January 22. The current measures have been extended until March 5. 1.1 million people have received the first doses of vaccines, the highest number in the EU. Italy’s second phase of their vaccination campaign will be slowed due to delivery delays caused by a change to the Pfizer-BioNTech’s production process that has reduced its supply by 165,000 doses. The prime minister, who recently won a vote of confidence, will lead a minority government after the Italia Viva party left the ruling coalition last week.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Italy, 17,243 new daily cases of COVID-19 infection were reported on January 15.. The state of emergency first introduced in January 2020 has been extended until the end of April 2021. Following the holidays, Italy returned to its three-tier system, which applies different measures to different regions based on their classification as yellow, orange, or red zones. A new white zone was created for regions with low risk levels and incidence rates. Within white zones, restrictive measures used in the other zones do not apply. On January 14, the current measures in place were extended until March 5. Ski resorts will not be permitted to reopen until February 15. Secondary schools resumed in-class learning on January 11 for 50% of students. Following internal disagreement about how the government was planning to use EU funds to tackle the economic crisis, the Italia Viva Party withdrew from the governing centre-left coalition.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 18, 15,401 new daily cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Italy. Over the holidays, Italy will go into a nationwide red-zone lockdown. On December 25-27, December 31-January 3, and January 5-6, eateries and non-essentials shops will be closed and people will not be permitted to leave their homes for non-essential reasons. On the days that fall in between, orange zone rules will be in effect. ÒOther measures include a ban on inter-regional travel between December 21 and January 6 and a national curfew from 10 pm to 5 am.Ó The country will begin its vaccination plan in early January and will give priority to healthcare workers, residents in long-term care homes, and people over 80.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 10, Italy reported 16,998 new daily cases of COVID-19. The number of daily cases and deaths are decreasing. The majority of COVID-19 cases are in the Veneto region. On December 13, Italy surpassed the United Kingdom as the country with the highest COVID-19 death toll in Europe.Effective December 10, cross-border train services between Italy and Switzerland will be suspended indefinitely due to the inability of train personnel to conduct government ordered COVID-19 safety checks. New restrictions will come into effect from December 21 to January 6 in an effort to avoid a rise in infections over the holidays. In response, Pope Francis will begin Christmas Eve Mass earlier, at 7:30 pm, to allow the limited number of people who can attend to return home in time for ItalyÕs 10 pm curfew.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Italy, new infections and hospital admissions have slowed but the country is reporting the most daily COVID-19 fatalities in Europe. New restrictions will be in effect from December 21 to January 6 in efforts to avoid a rise in infections over the holidays. Movement between regions will only be permitted for essential travel. On Christmas Day, Boxing Day, and New YearÕs Day, people are not permitted to leave their towns. During this time, a 14-day quarantine will be in effect for anyone entering the country and ski resorts will be closed. In a joint statement, regional governments were critical over the lack of consultation by the federal government about the new measures and the impacts they are having on families and small businesses. There has been tension between the federal government and regional authorities since the pandemic began.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Italy, daily death tolls remain high but hospital admissions and ICU occupancy rates are slowing. Effective November 29, rules in five regions were relaxed: Calabria, Lombardy, and Piedmont moved from the red to orange zone, and Liguria and Sicily moved to the yellow zone. In mid-January, Italy should be receiving 3.4 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with priority for the elderly and those most at risk of exposure. In the southern region of Campania, public hospitals in Naples can no longer accept all patients.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The second wave in Italy has killed 9,000 people: a rate of 4 deaths per 100 infections, the third highest rate in the world. On November 20, the government reported 37,239 new cases of COVID-19. In October, the government introduced a three-tiered system that separates regions into red, orange, and yellow. In red zones, residents can only leave home for essential purposes, but restrictions vary. ICU doctors are reporting significant strain in hospitals. Doctors are warning that an additional 10,000 deaths could be expected by December without the implementation of additional measures.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 14, Italy reported 37,249 new daily cases of COVID-19. Unlike the first wave, infections are no longer confined to the northern regions -- putting strain on hospitals throughout the country. More than half of ItalyÕs regions fall under the red (high-risk) or orange (medium-high risk) categories. Both categories impose limitations on movement and the scope of opening. Due to rising infections and deaths, doctors are calling for another national lockdown to ease pressures on the healthcare system. Many citizens are not willing to follow new restrictions, leading to rising tensions between the national government and local governments.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 8, Italy reported 39,809 new daily cases of COVID-19. An emergency decree came into effect on November 6 that divides Italy into a three-tier colour-coded system: red (high-risk), orange (medium-risk), and yellow (low-risk). Measures vary within these regions, with the most restrictive measures in red zones, which are in place in the Lombardy, Piedmont, and Calabria regions. In high risk areas, people are prohibited from moving within zones and may only leave their homes for work, health purposes, or to take their children to school. Distancing learning will begin for students in their final two years of middle school; high school and eateries would remain closed. In yellow zones, only national restrictions are in place, which include closure of shopping centres on weekends, a curfew on eateries, and a complete shutdown of theatres, gyms, and pools. ÒThe prime minister is struggling to build a coalition supporting more restrictive measures after protests emerged across Italy from workers and small businesses owners.Ó</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 29, Italy reported 24,991 new daily cases Ñ with Lombardy and Piedmont the hardest hit regions. ÒGyms, cinemas, and theatres are closed, and bars and restaurants must close at 6:00 pm. People are allowed to host up to 6 guests in their homes, while masks are deemed mandatory outdoors and in public buildings.ÓDemonstrations were held in multiple cities after the national governmentÕs order took effect closing or partially closing eateries, cinemas, and gyms; in response, Òthe government approved a financial aid package for businesses and workers affected by the restrictions.Ó</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 25, Italy reported a new daily record of 21, 273 cases.Compared to the first wave, cases are more widely distributed across the country. In efforts to avoid a national lockdown, local authorities have imposed several measures related to shops and schools. In the regions of Lombardy, Lazio, and Campagnia, curfews have been imposed with different levels of severity. Effective October 26, Restaurants and bars will close by 6:00 pm and public gyms, cinemas, and swimming pools will be shut down. Also, more than half of high school teaching is being moved online in efforts to limit the number of students in schools.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 18, Italy reported 11,705 new COVID-19 cases within a 24 hour period. In part, the recent rise has been linked to large evening gatherings outside restaurants and bars and vacations at home and abroad. Also, testing capacity has increased due to complaints about long wait times. The government announced several new COVID-19 restrictions that came into effect on October 13 relating to public gatherings, restaurants, recreation activities, and schools. Parties in restaurants and clubs have been banned and a maximum of 30 people can attend ceremonies such as weddings. The government strongly recommends that people do not host more than 6 people in their homes, and that face masks be worn when non-family members are present. At restaurants and bars, a curfew of midnight has been imposed and people cannot be served when standing after 9:00 pm. Pick-up sports have been banned unless officially organized. Schools remain open, but all non-classroom related activities have been banned. Emergency measures announced on October 18 give mayors the power to close off streets or squares after 9:00, granting access only to businesses and local residents.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 9, Italy had 5,372 new cases of COVID-19, nearly 1,000 more than the previous day. Numbers in the country have not been this high since mid-April with a concerning increase in the regions of Campania, Lazio, Piedmont, and Tuscany. The rise in infection rate has been linked to social gatherings. Effective October 8, people are now required to carry face masks with them at all times and wear masks always when outdoors. Travelers arriving to Italy from the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, and Czech Republic will be subject to mandatory testing. Mandatory testing is no longer required for travelers arriving from Croatia, Malta, and Greece. Also, the cabinet approved a decree to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency until January 31.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Daily case numbers are rising, but Italy has a fraction of the number of new cases when compared to neighboring countries. The current state of emergency expires mid-October, prompting the prime minister to extend the state of emergency until the end of January. Under a state of emergency, the central government has greater powers which makes it easier to bypass the civil service. The culture minister announced that free admission to state museums on Sundays will end this fall in efforts to avoid undervaluing the sites and reducing large crowds of tourists arriving on free days. The government approved the use of airport style rapid 30 minute COVID-19 tests in schools in order to ensure wider testing and results. ÒThe central Lazio region, which includes Rome, has issued an order making it mandatory to wear masks in public, including outdoors, effective October 3.Ó</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Italy, infections continue to rise most notably in regions such as Campagnia, Lazio, and Tuscany. The number of tests conducted has increased which could be related to the rise in confirmed cases. However, when compared to other countries in Europe, Italy has fewer new case numbers. The sports minister introduced a plan to reopen major sports stadiums to the public at 25% capacity, resulting in division amongst politicians and health experts. Health experts want the government to take a more cautious approach, while the majority of regional governments are in favour of increasing the number of spectators.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Students from 13 of 20 regions in Italy resumed in-class lessons on September 14. Days before schools reopened, 13,000 teachers and staff tested positive for COVID-19 and are not allowed to return to work until they test negative. The Union of Italian Students is planning demonstrations regarding the insufficient number of teachers and the lack of transport services. Due to rising case numbers, Italy will begin mandatory COVID-19 testing for travellers returning from Paris and other areas of France effective September 22. Fears of a second wave of infections has impacted tourism with many overseas visitors cancelling travel plans. Also, Italy’s largest source of tourism comes from the United States and the ongoing travel ban preventing Americans from entering the country is having an impact.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Under Italy’s COVID-19 state of emergency, a new decree was issued on September 7 and remains in effect until October 7. Masks remain compulsory in enclosed public spaces and outdoor areas between 6 pm and 6 am. An exception has been made to allow for the reunification of international couples. A cap of 1,000 people for outdoor gatherings and 200 people for indoor gatherings remains in effect. Schools will reopen on September 14 in most regions in Italy, with a few regional exceptions. Teachers unions have agreed to the detailed plans for safely returning to school, as proposed by the Ministry of Education. Measures include mandatory face mask requirements for students over age 6, a 1 metre distance between students, and a plan to hire additional teachers in an effort to reduce class sizes. Schools will have the option to alternate in-person with remote instructions, but the government has stressed the importance of getting students back in class, especially at the primary level.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The daily number of new cases in Italy continues to rise. Travellers from several non-EU countries have been banned from entering Italy. Restrictions and testing requirements have been imposed on people returning from hard-hit European countries. In Italy, the majority of new cases stem from young holidaymakers returning from Greece, Spain, Malta, and Croatia--prompting the government to implement mandatory testing on arrival. Airport testing is occurring mainly in two regions: Lombardy, which includes Milan, and Lazio, which includes Rome. Some airports are not offering on-site tests, forcing people to go to local screening centres in order to comply with regulations.  Italy has taken additional countermeasures, including closing nightclubs and discos and making masks mandatory at night in public spaces.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Travellers arriving in Italy from Croatia, Greece, Malta, and Spain will be tested for COVID-19. Many clusters have emerged in central and southern Italy, linked to foreigners returning for work at farms, restaurants, and hotels. In the southern region of Puglia, recent infections have been traced back to returning travellers. In the northeastern region of Veneto, new infections were found in residents returning from Spain, Malta, Croatia, and Greece. Italy has ordered the three-week closure of all dance venues. The government has made face masks mandatory in public areas between 6 pm and 6 am.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government has issued the August decree under Italy’s COVID-19 state of emergency, which will come into effect on August 10. The measures will be in place until at least September 7. The new decree keeps in place Italy’s rules related to travel and to the mandatory use of face masks in enclosed public spaces. Cruise ships can resume from August 15, but will only be able to sail between countries in the EU. Safety precautions should be taken on board. Effective September 1, fans will be allowed to watch minor sporting events: 1,000 spectators will be allowed to attend outdoor events and 200 will be permitted indoors. The same cap applies to audiences at concerts and events. Schools in Italy will reopen in September following a protocol signed by the Education Ministry and trade unions on August 6. The government has committed to passing a legislation that will set a maximum number of students per class. All visitors to the school must be registered and staff will undergo tests at the start of the term. The Health Minister ordered train and bus operators to continue leaving seats empty to limit contact between passengers after companies began selling all available seats. However, some regional governments have allowed local transport to continue running at full capacity.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 27, a request by the PM to extend the current state of emergency until October 15 was approved in the upper house of Parliament. This extension expands both regional and central government powers related to COVID-19 restrictions, such as declaring red zones and increasing hospital resources. The Opposition is accusing the PM of trying to keep too much power--citing the fall in the rate of infections in Italy.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Italian government extended their current Phase 3 emergency rules until July 31. The Italian media is reporting that the government is expected to extend the state of emergency until October 31. Visitors to Italy’s island of Capri will be required to wear masks outdoors because crowds have grown at the popular holiday destination. The rule will be in effect until July 31 to help with reduced police staff, limited hospital facilities, and difficulties transporting patients back to the mainland. In Rome, two piazzas were sealed off temporarily over the weekend due to large gatherings associated with nightlife.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 16, the Italian government banned travellers who had been in Serbia, Kosovo, and Montenegro in the past 14 days from entering the country. Italy had already banned entry to travellers from 13 other countries that have a high rate of infection. Movement remains restricted within the EU, Schengen Area, and the UK—with travellers from all other countries subject to a 14-day quarantine. The Italian government has extended their current Phase 3 emergency rules until July 31. These include social distancing rules, mask requirements in closed public places and on public transit, and the suspension of large gatherings. An activist group is providing testimony to prosecutors investigating whether the failure of political leaders in Lombardy and nationally contributed to the country’s COVID-19 death toll. The Lombardy regional government has defended its handling of the pandemic and the region’s success in increasing ICU capacity to keep up with patient demand.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Italian government is calling for the EU to introduce precautionary measures for all passengers arriving from non-EU countries to slow the spread of COVID-19. On July 6, Italian authorities suspended all flights from Bangladesh for a week after a significant number of passengers arriving from Dhaka tested positive. The decision was made in order to try to contain an outbreak among the Bangladeshi community in the Lazio region, which has begun increased testing for COVID-19. On July 9, the Health Minister signed an ordinance banning the entry of people arriving from at-risk countries, including Brazil, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Chile. Various regions around the country have decided to increase health checks in order to prevent outbreaks. In the Veneto region, authorities have introduced legal repercussions against citizens who do not follow self-isolation measures. Fines will be given to people violating the mandatory quarantine period. Swab tests are mandatory for anyone returning from outside of the EU with a temperature higher than 37.5 degrees Celsius. People who test positive in the region but refuse hospital treatment (if needed) could face a prison sentence under the new regulations.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While most EU member countries have agreed to reopen their external borders to visitors, Italy will be keeping its travel ban in place for tourists outside of the EU and Schengen Area. The decision stems from the government’s concern that reopening external borders could lead to another outbreak. Also, there is concern about non-EU travellers arriving in Italy through other Schengen countries, which is possible due to the freedom of movement rules in place. To combat this, the government is considering implementing police checks other than those at the borders, such as in hotels. The government has not given any indication of how long it expects the travel ban to remain in place. The government sent soldiers to a coastal town near Naples to restore order after an outbreak occurred at an overcrowded apartment complex illegally occupied by migrant workers. The entire town may be quarantined after 40 people tested positive, with plans to test 3,000 people living around the occupied buildings.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Italy, theatres and cinemas have reopened with performances to be held with pre-assigned and spaced seating, in order to maintain at least one metre distance between staff and spectators. There is a limit of 1000 spectators for outdoor gatherings and 200 people for gatherings in closed, indoor spaces. Soccer matches are being played in empty stadiums and government authorities are working on allowing fans back in July. Effective June 25, amateur contact sports are allowed to resume. Schools will reopen in September, but the Education Ministry has yet to publish official guidelines for the upcoming school year. Italy’s 20 administrative regions have proposed their own protocols and teaching outside is one solution being suggested to help students safely return to classes. Moving schools outdoors will require significant commitment from education authorities and will change expectations for teachers, parents and children. Social distancing requirements at restaurants have led to greater adoption of digital technologies by many small businesses in Italy; many are using digital booking systems and menus.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, Italy is entering Phase 3 of its gradual unlocking strategy with nearly all businesses reopened. Cinemas and theatres have reopened, but no more than 200 people can attend events at indoor venues and there is a maximum of 1,000 attendees at outdoor events. This rule also applies to museums, art galleries and nightclubs. Online booking is required when visiting cultural sites and using contact services. On June 25, summer camps and kindergartens can reopen but classes will not resume for students until September. Despite reopening its borders to travellers from the EU and Schengen area, Italy has not guaranteed reopening to international tourists. Regional travel variation exists with arrivals from Rome and Naples being subject to temperature checks and COVID-19 testing at their airports. The prime minister, health minister and interior minister were questioned by prosecutors about the government’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak in an attempt to determine whether there are grounds for criminal negligence charges. Regional authorities and the central government are trading blame for the shortcomings of Italy’s COVID-19 response. The outcome of the investigation will be used as a political tool against the party blamed for the mismanagement. The division between parties is prevalent and has affected how the outbreak was handled, despite hopes for collaboration earlier in the outbreak.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Bergamo, a province in northern Italy’s hardest hit Lombardy region, 57% of residents who had blood tests were found to have COVID-19 antibodies. The Italian government released a contact tracing app called Immuni, a voluntary app that uses Bluetooth technology to exchange information between users' phones. While the app can already be downloaded, it is being tested this week in four regions before being extended nationwide. The release of the app was delayed due to citizen resistance because of privacy concerns which has since been mitigated with assurances of anonymity. Despite criticism that 60% of the population must download the app for it to be effective, a poll showed that only 44% of citizens are likely to download the app. The app is intended to act as an early warning system for the virus in order to lower the risk of more serious consequences in the event of a second wave in the fall. Mayors in Florence and Venice are aiming to leverage the current crisis to shift towards emphasizing slow tourism within their cities. These cities intend to cater to tourists that stay in the city and experience the museums and restaurants, rather than to day-trip tourists in the future.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 1, several cultural sites reopened including the Vatican Museums, the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa, under measures which include physical distancing, and temperature checks. On June 20, Italy’s Serie A soccer league will resume. Freedom of movement was restored on June 3 allowing Italians to travel freely in the country and EU visitors to enter without quarantine requirements. In response, regional governors are pressing for some ability to trace tourists or to test them to ensure that transmission is contained. In four of Italy’s twenty regions, contact tracing apps are currently being used to help the country avoid a second wave. Four weeks into the country’s easing plan, the number of cases continues to decline, resulting in some Italian doctors suggesting that “the virus no longer exists in Italy.” The Head of Milan’s San Raffaele Hospital urged the Italian government to continue lifting measures, arguing preparations for a second wave are creating unnecessary fear. However, the Health Minister said there is insufficient evidence to back up these claims and urged Italians to continue following guidelines. On Italy’s Republic Day, Orange Vest protests emerged across  regional capitals. Hundreds gathered to protest the government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis and to call for its resignation. In Rome, the parties making up the opposition held a joint rally against the government's policies. These protests defied government orders to maintain social distancing and to use masks in busy spaces.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective June 3, Italian borders will reopen for travel to all citizens of the Schengen area without exceptions or quarantine; travel between regions will also be allowed. Italy will not open to international tourists yet but will likely filter high-risk countries based on pandemic trends and infection levels. Some hotels will reopen on June 1, depending on the number of bookings. Since May 25, gyms and swimming pools have reopened under strict hygiene and social distancing rules which include appointments, temperature checks, and the use of masks upon entering facilities. The Italian government is encouraging remote training and some regions have delayed this reopening phase until May 31. Sports teams are able to hold group training but competitive matches remain banned. The next phase is set to begin on June 3 but, Regional Affairs Minister, Francesco Boccia, said the government will not open up travel between Italian regions if mass social gatherings continue. Mayors across Italy have begun imposing new restrictions in response to crowds across the country as officials warn about the danger of a second wave of infections. The Italian government announced that 60,000 people could be employed to help enforce social distancing and the use of masks in public places but, this plan has been met with opposition.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In its second phase of reopening, hospital networks across Italy have increased their number of beds and reduced the number of patients requiring intensive care, showing that the situation is currently sustainable for future phases. Italy will begin testing a representative sample of 150,000 people across 2,000 cities next week in order to understand the extent of COVID-19’s impact on the country. Restrictions on shops, eateries, and churches were eased on May 18, but social distancing measures will remain in effect. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to operate with a limited capacity, and no standing room will be available at the bar. There is widespread discontent among restaurant and bar owners with regard to the guidelines set by the national government, with many arguing that the rules are unclear, and that the sector requires more concrete help in order to stay open. On May 25, gyms, pools, and sport centres will be allowed to reopen. The Italian government plans to begin easing restrictions on movement, announcing on May 16 that all airports will be permitted to continue domestic and international travel by June 3.</p>
