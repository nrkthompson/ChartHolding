  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government has issued the August decree under Italy’s COVID-19 state of emergency, which will come into effect on August 10. The measures will be in place until at least September 7. The new decree keeps in place Italy’s rules related to travel and to the mandatory use of face masks in enclosed public spaces. Cruise ships can resume from August 15, but will only be able to sail between countries in the EU. Safety precautions should be taken on board. Effective September 1, fans will be allowed to watch minor sporting events: 1,000 spectators will be allowed to attend outdoor events and 200 will be permitted indoors. The same cap applies to audiences at concerts and events. Schools in Italy will reopen in September following a protocol signed by the Education Ministry and trade unions on August 6. The government has committed to passing a legislation that will set a maximum number of students per class. All visitors to the school must be registered and staff will undergo tests at the start of the term. The Health Minister ordered train and bus operators to continue leaving seats empty to limit contact between passengers after companies began selling all available seats. However, some regional governments have allowed local transport to continue running at full capacity.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 27, a request by the PM to extend the current state of emergency until October 15 was approved in the upper house of Parliament. This extension expands both regional and central government powers related to COVID-19 restrictions, such as declaring red zones and increasing hospital resources. The Opposition is accusing the PM of trying to keep too much power--citing the fall in the rate of infections in Italy.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Italian government extended their current Phase 3 emergency rules until July 31. The Italian media is reporting that the government is expected to extend the state of emergency until October 31. Visitors to Italy’s island of Capri will be required to wear masks outdoors because crowds have grown at the popular holiday destination. The rule will be in effect until July 31 to help with reduced police staff, limited hospital facilities, and difficulties transporting patients back to the mainland. In Rome, two piazzas were sealed off temporarily over the weekend due to large gatherings associated with nightlife.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 16, the Italian government banned travellers who had been in Serbia, Kosovo, and Montenegro in the past 14 days from entering the country. Italy had already banned entry to travellers from 13 other countries that have a high rate of infection. Movement remains restricted within the EU, Schengen Area, and the UK—with travellers from all other countries subject to a 14-day quarantine. The Italian government has extended their current Phase 3 emergency rules until July 31. These include social distancing rules, mask requirements in closed public places and on public transit, and the suspension of large gatherings. An activist group is providing testimony to prosecutors investigating whether the failure of political leaders in Lombardy and nationally contributed to the country’s COVID-19 death toll. The Lombardy regional government has defended its handling of the pandemic and the region’s success in increasing ICU capacity to keep up with patient demand.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Italian government is calling for the EU to introduce precautionary measures for all passengers arriving from non-EU countries to slow the spread of COVID-19. On July 6, Italian authorities suspended all flights from Bangladesh for a week after a significant number of passengers arriving from Dhaka tested positive. The decision was made in order to try to contain an outbreak among the Bangladeshi community in the Lazio region, which has begun increased testing for COVID-19. On July 9, the Health Minister signed an ordinance banning the entry of people arriving from at-risk countries, including Brazil, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Chile. Various regions around the country have decided to increase health checks in order to prevent outbreaks. In the Veneto region, authorities have introduced legal repercussions against citizens who do not follow self-isolation measures. Fines will be given to people violating the mandatory quarantine period. Swab tests are mandatory for anyone returning from outside of the EU with a temperature higher than 37.5 degrees Celsius. People who test positive in the region but refuse hospital treatment (if needed) could face a prison sentence under the new regulations.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While most EU member countries have agreed to reopen their external borders to visitors, Italy will be keeping its travel ban in place for tourists outside of the EU and Schengen Area. The decision stems from the government’s concern that reopening external borders could lead to another outbreak. Also, there is concern about non-EU travellers arriving in Italy through other Schengen countries, which is possible due to the freedom of movement rules in place. To combat this, the government is considering implementing police checks other than those at the borders, such as in hotels. The government has not given any indication of how long it expects the travel ban to remain in place. The government sent soldiers to a coastal town near Naples to restore order after an outbreak occurred at an overcrowded apartment complex illegally occupied by migrant workers. The entire town may be quarantined after 40 people tested positive, with plans to test 3,000 people living around the occupied buildings.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Italy, theatres and cinemas have reopened with performances to be held with pre-assigned and spaced seating, in order to maintain at least one metre distance between staff and spectators. There is a limit of 1000 spectators for outdoor gatherings and 200 people for gatherings in closed, indoor spaces. Soccer matches are being played in empty stadiums and government authorities are working on allowing fans back in July. Effective June 25, amateur contact sports are allowed to resume. Schools will reopen in September, but the Education Ministry has yet to publish official guidelines for the upcoming school year. Italy’s 20 administrative regions have proposed their own protocols and teaching outside is one solution being suggested to help students safely return to classes. Moving schools outdoors will require significant commitment from education authorities and will change expectations for teachers, parents and children. Social distancing requirements at restaurants have led to greater adoption of digital technologies by many small businesses in Italy; many are using digital booking systems and menus.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">This week, Italy is entering Phase 3 of its gradual unlocking strategy with nearly all businesses reopened. Cinemas and theatres have reopened, but no more than 200 people can attend events at indoor venues and there is a maximum of 1,000 attendees at outdoor events. This rule also applies to museums, art galleries and nightclubs. Online booking is required when visiting cultural sites and using contact services. On June 25, summer camps and kindergartens can reopen but classes will not resume for students until September. Despite reopening its borders to travellers from the EU and Schengen area, Italy has not guaranteed reopening to international tourists. Regional travel variation exists with arrivals from Rome and Naples being subject to temperature checks and COVID-19 testing at their airports. The prime minister, health minister and interior minister were questioned by prosecutors about the government’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak in an attempt to determine whether there are grounds for criminal negligence charges. Regional authorities and the central government are trading blame for the shortcomings of Italy’s COVID-19 response. The outcome of the investigation will be used as a political tool against the party blamed for the mismanagement. The division between parties is prevalent and has affected how the outbreak was handled, despite hopes for collaboration earlier in the outbreak.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Bergamo, a province in northern Italy’s hardest hit Lombardy region, 57% of residents who had blood tests were found to have COVID-19 antibodies. The Italian government released a contact tracing app called Immuni, a voluntary app that uses Bluetooth technology to exchange information between users' phones. While the app can already be downloaded, it is being tested this week in four regions before being extended nationwide. The release of the app was delayed due to citizen resistance because of privacy concerns which has since been mitigated with assurances of anonymity. Despite criticism that 60% of the population must download the app for it to be effective, a poll showed that only 44% of citizens are likely to download the app. The app is intended to act as an early warning system for the virus in order to lower the risk of more serious consequences in the event of a second wave in the fall. Mayors in Florence and Venice are aiming to leverage the current crisis to shift towards emphasizing slow tourism within their cities. These cities intend to cater to tourists that stay in the city and experience the museums and restaurants, rather than to day-trip tourists in the future.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 1, several cultural sites reopened including the Vatican Museums, the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa, under measures which include physical distancing, and temperature checks. On June 20, Italy’s Serie A soccer league will resume. Freedom of movement was restored on June 3 allowing Italians to travel freely in the country and EU visitors to enter without quarantine requirements. In response, regional governors are pressing for some ability to trace tourists or to test them to ensure that transmission is contained. In four of Italy’s twenty regions, contact tracing apps are currently being used to help the country avoid a second wave. Four weeks into the country’s easing plan, the number of cases continues to decline, resulting in some Italian doctors suggesting that “the virus no longer exists in Italy.” The Head of Milan’s San Raffaele Hospital urged the Italian government to continue lifting measures, arguing preparations for a second wave are creating unnecessary fear. However, the Health Minister said there is insufficient evidence to back up these claims and urged Italians to continue following guidelines. On Italy’s Republic Day, Orange Vest protests emerged across  regional capitals. Hundreds gathered to protest the government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis and to call for its resignation. In Rome, the parties making up the opposition held a joint rally against the government's policies. These protests defied government orders to maintain social distancing and to use masks in busy spaces.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective June 3, Italian borders will reopen for travel to all citizens of the Schengen area without exceptions or quarantine; travel between regions will also be allowed. Italy will not open to international tourists yet but will likely filter high-risk countries based on pandemic trends and infection levels. Some hotels will reopen on June 1, depending on the number of bookings. Since May 25, gyms and swimming pools have reopened under strict hygiene and social distancing rules which include appointments, temperature checks, and the use of masks upon entering facilities. The Italian government is encouraging remote training and some regions have delayed this reopening phase until May 31. Sports teams are able to hold group training but competitive matches remain banned. The next phase is set to begin on June 3 but, Regional Affairs Minister, Francesco Boccia, said the government will not open up travel between Italian regions if mass social gatherings continue. Mayors across Italy have begun imposing new restrictions in response to crowds across the country as officials warn about the danger of a second wave of infections. The Italian government announced that 60,000 people could be employed to help enforce social distancing and the use of masks in public places but, this plan has been met with opposition.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In its second phase of reopening, hospital networks across Italy have increased their number of beds and reduced the number of patients requiring intensive care, showing that the situation is currently sustainable for future phases. Italy will begin testing a representative sample of 150,000 people across 2,000 cities next week in order to understand the extent of COVID-19’s impact on the country. Restrictions on shops, eateries, and churches were eased on May 18, but social distancing measures will remain in effect. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to operate with a limited capacity, and no standing room will be available at the bar. There is widespread discontent among restaurant and bar owners with regard to the guidelines set by the national government, with many arguing that the rules are unclear, and that the sector requires more concrete help in order to stay open. On May 25, gyms, pools, and sport centres will be allowed to reopen. The Italian government plans to begin easing restrictions on movement, announcing on May 16 that all airports will be permitted to continue domestic and international travel by June 3.</p>
