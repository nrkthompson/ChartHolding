      Per 100,000 people, Mexico ranked seventh globally for the most COVID-19 deaths and fourteenth for the most cases as of June 9. Four states experienced increases in COVID-19 cases greater than 100%, five states reported downward trends in cases and one state maintained the same level of active cases for two weeks. Several hospitals reported themselves at capacity. On June 9, Deputy Minister of Health Hugo Lopez-Gatell stated that Mexico’s daily number of new cases had not peaked and that the country would experience additional weeks of rising daily numbers of cases. In Mexico City, masks are required. Although most of the country is in lockdown, as of June 1, with some restrictions being relaxed, general movement in Mexico increased. In lockdown, hotels have limited capacity, personal care services can be in-home with appointments, parks are open in some regions and essential services are open. With intergovernmental cooperation, preparations for the tourism sector are underway by exploring travel insurance, discounts and mobile reservations. Medical staff protest lack of appropriate PPE. The government was criticized for relaxing restrictions while the country is peaking and expert estimates for the COVID-19 death toll increased from 16,000 to between 43,000 and 51,000 this summer. Attention towards excessive police force is growing after Giovanni Lopez was killed in police custody while being detained for not wearing a mask.
