  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 1, the majority of mainland Portugal went into alert due to a rise in COVID-19 cases.  The Metropolitan Area of Lisbon (AML) entered the contingency state; 19 parishes in five municipalities within the AML remained at the calamity state. The restrictions imposed in mainland Portugal include strict observation of social distancing rules. Gatherings are limited to 20 people. However, within the AML, gatherings are limited to 10 people; most commercial establishments are required to close by 8pm and hypermarkets and supermarkets are required to close by 10pm. However, there is no closing time requirement for fuel supply services, pharmacies, offices and clinics. The five municipalities in the state of calamity have stricter restrictions: gatherings are limited to 5 people and fairs and markets remain closed. People are also allowed to leave only for the purposes of work, shopping, playing sports or providing assistance to family members. Despite the situation in Portugal, Spain reopened its borders with Portugal, both by land and air on July 1, with no swab test to be performed at the border. Portugal allows flights to and from its territory to countries of the Schengen Zone, the EU and the UK, effective July 3. However, travellers from Portuguese-speaking countries and the US are required to present proof of a negative COVID-19 test at the time of departure.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">After entering phase three of deconfinement on June 15, the metropolitan area of Lisbon witnessed a spike in COVID-19 cases, causing new lockdown measures to be implemented within the region effective June 23.  These include a reduction in gatherings from 20 to 10 people and an 8pm curfew on commercial spaces, with the exception of restaurants and catering establishments providing home delivery, directly or through an intermediary, which can remain open till midnight. However, restaurants  are no longer allowed to serve drinks after the 8pm curfew, and drinking in public spaces outside of licensed esplanades is also prohibited. In a quest to support the regional economy and sector tourism in Southern Portugal, Ryanair announced the re-establishment of 37 routes to and from Faro, as of  July 1, as part of their summer 2020 schedule. Turismo de Portugal has also launched the ‘Clean & Safe’ website on June 24, making it possible for tourists to leave reviews about the tourist developments they visit, in order to address public and safety concerns within those areas.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, the Metropolitan area of Lisbon entered phase three of deconfinement, a week after the rest of the country entered the third phase, following a reduction in the outbreak of COVID-19 cases. The same rules now apply in Lisbon as the rest of the country which includes the reopening of  large shopping centres, commercial establishments of over 400 square metres, leisure centres and water parks, along with an increase in gathering limit of 10 to 20 people. Even though Spain has announced the reopening of its borders to countries in the EU’s Schengen area effective June 21, free movement to Portugal is only allowed starting July 1. Portugal’s Covid-tracking app, ‘stay away’ is due to be launched by the end of June. Through bluetooth technology, it aims to provide ‘rapid alert’ to users who have been in contact with someone who has since been diagnosed with COVID-19. The science and technology minister has guaranteed that all data collected by the app will be anonymous, with the use of it voluntary. The minister expects a number of public and private institutions to recommend the use of the app – suggesting that while it will not be mandatory, people may end up being persuaded to download the software to satisfy requests in their day-to-day routines.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Portugal’s national airline, TAP Air Portugal, resumed nonstop flights between Lisbon and Newark airport last week, following the completion of the country’s three-phase reopening strategy, with the formal  allowance of  E.U. citizens, except Spain and Italy, to enter via air on June 6. Although the country’s land border with Spain will remain closed until June 15, travellers arriving by air will not be required to quarantine but will have to face minimal health controls, in accordance to the country’s lockdown rules. Flights to and from selected countries such as the USA, UK, Canada and Brazil are scheduled to resume by mid June. Unlike some other countries now accepting tourists, mainland Portugal has discarded the requirement of a compulsory two week isolation period for the new arrivals. Upon experiencing a relatively COVID-19 free spring, hotels and other accommodations reopened last week, with local tourism boards awarding a new ‘Clean & Safe’ badge to hotels and restaurants who have implemented new hygiene measures, including no buffets. Additionally, beaches reopened on June 6, with an app launched to help monitor capacity and aid in maintaining distance between sunbathers. As of June 9, the government announced its plan to progress to the state of contingency, effective July 1, from the state of calamity, which has been in place since May 3,  if cases continue to decrease.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 1, Portugal entered the third phase of its reopening strategy with several restrictions being lifted in most areas of the country with the exception of Lisbon, where different rules have been implemented regarding large gatherings. The civic self isolation rule  is no longer established, with meetings of up to 20 people allowed in all areas except the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon where the limit is only up to 10. Celebrations are permitted to be held with gatherings of 20 people allowed, followed by the guidelines determined by the Directorate-General for Health, namely within the capacity of religious ceremonies, family events (including weddings and baptisms, whether for civil or religious or other commemorative events) and corporate events held in spaces suitable for this purpose. The rule of mandatory teleworking is eliminated; however, daily and weekly shifts, with ‘mirrored’ teams are suggested to be adopted by the government. Stores located in shopping centres with an area greater than 400 m2 reopened with social distancing rules, except in the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon. Under respected guidelines defined by the Directorate-General for Health, most contact services also resumed operations, including casinos and tattoo services. Restaurants and food courts reopened in all areas except Lisbon, with unlimited capacity but with the maintenance of 1.5m distance between tables and separation barriers installed between the customers seated face to face. Outdoor cultural events, along with theatres, cinemas and auditoriums reopened with the occupation of all rows, mandatory application of masks  and space reserved between the spectators and the audience. The  infrastructures for the practice of individual sports also reopened along with gyms and  indoor/outdoor pools with proposed measures in place.Effective June 4, Portugal’s national airline, TAP Air Portugal, is scheduled to resume nonstop flights between Lisbon and Newark airport, following the completion of the country’s three-phase reopening strategy, with the formal  allowance of  E.U. nationals, except Spain and Italy, to enter via air on June 6.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As part of the phase 3 deconfinement plan set out by the government,  malls and hotels are set to reopen with social distancing and COVID-19 protection measures in place, effective June 1st.  The guests at the hotel will not be able to check in to their rooms until 24 hours after the previous guests have left. Sunbeds will be given exclusively to hotel guests and buffets are unlikely to resume. Beaches will reopen by June 6th, with new rules in place, requiring sunbathers to stay 1.5 metres apart, with their umbrellas at  3 metres apart. The number of people on a beach will be strictly controlled, with a traffic light system in place to show the capacity available. This information will be made available in real time by the Portuguese Environment Agency, through an app. While the dates for reopening of hotels and beaches have already been set, nothing has been announced for the resumption of flights into the country, even though the PM did give a welcome back statement to tourists from May 22nd,  with precautionary measures at airports and no compulsory quarantine in place. Earlier this month, Portugal's flag carrier TAP did resume some of its international operations, with flights to London and Paris, but flights outside the EU are still temporarily suspended.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 15th, the PM announced the reopening of beaches, effective June 6th, with an adherence to the 1.5 metre distance rule within groups, booking of deck-chairs, and restrictions on group beach sports. Downloading of an app was also encouraged by the PM, which updates the beach-goers on the availability of  space at their beach of choice. The app will use real-time mobile data and numbers registered by beach businesses to establish an estimate of the number of people present at a beach, during a particular time. Followed by the stability in the number of  COVID-19 cases in Portugal, the Government also moved onto its second phase of deflation, effective May 18th, under which restaurants, cafes, and pastry shops, are now allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Terraces and street shops of up to 400 square metres, are allowed to reopen along with tourist establishments and local accommodations, with the ability to offer drinks and catering services to the public. High school students and day care centres reopened with new rules, such as the obligatory testing of all daycare workers, and the mandatory application of masks by all secondary school students. Visits to elderly homes with prior appointments are also permitted under authorisation, with the number of visits allowed per week limited to one 90 minute meeting. Museums across the country also reopened with on-site and online exhibitions and initiatives, with  safety standards such as the use of masks and social distancing measures as a prerequisite.</p>
