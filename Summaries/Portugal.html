  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Portugal has reported more than 1,000 new daily COVID-19 cases for the first time since April. The country will remain under a state of contingency until October 14, under which gatherings are limited to 10 people and commercial establishments close between 8pm and 11pm. Mainland Portugal remains on the UK's quarantine list, which includes Lisbon and the Algarve, while Madeira and the Azores are not.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government announced a prolongment in the state of contingency until October 14 due to the increase in COVID-19 cases recorded over the past weeks. The contingency in mainland Portugal has been in place since September 15. Public gatherings have been limited to 10 people, unless each member belongs to the same household, and a ban is in place on the sale of alcoholic beverages applying from 8pm onwards. The opening hours of establishments are determined by each local council and are based upon the decisions of local health authorities and security forces. In restaurants, cafes, and pastry shops located 300 metres from schools, there is a maximum limit of four people per group, unless they belong to the same household.A free mobile app has been created for psychological intervention in crisis for those who need it as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The promoters of the app "Psicovida" explained that the application allows users to speak directly with "accredited" psychologists through video calls, stressing that the platform "is confidential and safeguards users' rights."</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Portugal’s government outlined a ten-year Recovery and Resilience Programme to aid a series of reforms and investments from early next year through to 2030. An outline of the draft was unveiled on September 21 drawing criticism from opposition parties, who argued that the focus of the plan should be on companies, while others pointed out that hiring health professionals is a priority. The prime minister stated that it is essential that the European Union approves the plan and regulations, but the country must put it to work as quickly as possible. Portugal has extended measures to curb the COVID-19 pandemic until at least mid-October. The country will remain under a state of contingency until October 14, which means gatherings will continue to be limited to 10 people and commercial establishments must close between 8 pm and 11 pm. Authorities have also banned alcohol sales after 8 pm, except for in restaurants, and drinking in public spaces. On September 23, Germany added the Lisbon Metropolitan Area to its ‘red list’ of regions that present a risk due to COVID-19 infections. Tourists returning from these areas are required to take a mandatory test and remain in quarantine while awaiting the result. The ministry advised against “non-essential tourist trips” to these regions, since the number of new infections exceeds the limit of 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in seven days.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 15, mainland Portugal limited gatherings to 10 people.  Additional measures are in place for the Lisbon and Porto Metropolitan areas, where the risk of COVID-19 is higher. In the Autonomous Region of Madeira, the calamity situation has also been extended by the regional government until the end of September. In the Autonomous Region of the Azores, the same level was extended until September 15. The measures implemented by the government in mainland Portugal include closing times for some establishments, with restaurants allowed to remain open until 1 am and receive customers until 12 am for meals. In shopping centre catering areas, a maximum of four people per group are allowed. The return to school in person means the adoption of new health measures, including the distribution of personal protective equipment and a maximum of four people per group allowed in restaurants and cafes 300 meters away from schools. Sporting venues continue without spectators.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 10, Portugal saw its largest daily increase in COVID-19 infections since April -- part of a recent uptick in coronavirus cases across Western Europe. The PM warned that the country is entering "a critical phase" due to the change of season, the beginning of the school year, and the resumption of many activities. He said that the country cannot stop for a second time as it did in March and April -- arguing that, from a social and economic point of view, it is not sustainable. Next week, over a million school children prepare for a return to school. However, the teachersí union is threatening strike action unless ìessential questionsî about safety are answered. The first is the scientific basis behind the guideline that pupils can be placed ìwithin a metre distance of each other in the classroomî -- as opposed to the two-meters required in everyday contact elsewhere. The second question concerns school staff in the at risk groups ñ whether they will be able to take time off and whether their absence will be filled by replacements. Given that the questions remain unanswered as of September 10, the union plans to launch a pre-strike warning.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 20, Portugal was added to the UK's air travel corridor list which exempts visitors from the need to quarantine upon return to the UK. Effective August 22, passengers arriving in the UK from Portugal are no longer required to self-isolate--so long as they have not been in, or transited through, any non-exempt countries in the fourteen days preceding their arrival. Passengers arriving in the UK before that deadline will be required to complete the full 14 day self-isolation period. On August 21, the Prime Minister confirmed Portugalís purchase of 6.9 million vaccines--the result of coordination with other European Union countries. Largo da SÈ, in Faro, plans to host 20 live concerts until 13 September to celebrate Festival F. The vice-mayor of Faro said that this alternative format will present a concert per night at 10pm, outdoors, with a capacity of 937 seats. The use of masks will be mandatory.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Lisbon will remain under tougher COVID-19 restrictions than the rest of the country until at least the end of August. Even though the number of infections in Lisbon has fallen again, the government wants to proceed slowly--considering that some of Europe's top soccer teams are in the city for a special 'Final Eight' UEFA Champions League mini-tournament. Greater Lisbon will stay under the so-called state of contingency, meaning most commercial spaces, excluding restaurants, must shut by 8 pm. There is also a 10-person limit for gatherings, compared to a 20-person limit across the rest of the nation. The PM has nevertheless encouraged fans and tourists to visit the country during the Champions League tournament, which kicked off on August 12--even though supporters have been barred from the stadiums. As of August 13, Poland became the latest EU state to lift travel restrictions on Portugal. The UK has still not added Portugal to their list.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Portugalís national tourism authority, Turismo de Portugal, has launched a travel insurance scheme for foreign tourists that covers COVID-19 related claims. Visitors who are planning their holidays in Portugal will be able to acquire Portugal Travel Insurance, a policy adapted to the new reality the pandemic has brought about. The initiative is promoted by RNA Seguros de AssistÍncia and is available online. Coverage extends to the entire national territory and includes medical, surgical, pharmaceutical and hospital expenses associated with COVID-19--as well as cancellation, interruption or extension expenses. On August 7, the President of the Republic announced the resumption of all major events planned for September as long as public health rules are respected. Bars and clubs, which have been closed in Portugal since March, were allowed to function as cafes and pastry shops effective August 1. Bars and clubs that opted for the reopening can operate until 8 pm in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and until 1 am (with entry limit at midnight) in the rest of the continental territory.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 31, the government of Madeira announced its decision to extend the state of calamity in the archipelago until August 31. Masks are mandatory in all public places. The entire Lisbon Metropolitan Area (AML) is to remain in the state of contingency, while the rest of mainland Portugal stays on alert for at least another 15 days. Measures in the AML include mandatory home or hospital confinement for people infected with COVID-19 or subject to active surveillance. Up to 10 people are allowed to gather outdoors, while the consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited. Restaurants are only allowed to operate beyond 8 pm for on-site meals (both inside establishments and on licensed terraces), on a take-away or home delivery service. No closing time is imposed on fuel supply services, pharmacies, funeral homes, sports equipment stores, clinics, offices and veterinarians. Despite the number of cases in Portugal, Denmark removed the mobility restrictions previously imposed on passengers coming from Portugal, effective August 1, due to Portugalís ability to test on a large scale, detect positive cases, control their transmission, and treat them in the appropriate way.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Portugal may be included in the list of countries exempted from quarantine on arrival in the UK in the next few days when the UK government updates its ìair bridgeî policy. Once added to the list of 59 countries, passengers would be able to travel without the need to isolate upon return. The move came after intensive lobbying from the Portuguese government, which was angered by the ìabsurdî decision to leave the country off the original list of COVID-safe travel corridors in July. On July 23, the Portuguese government announced the possible resumption of all team sport competitions by the end of August. While health and safety remain paramount, the government is set to channel additional funding to support clubs and institutions affected by the pandemic.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On 15 July, the Regional Government of the Azores announced its decision to extend the public calamity situation on five islands with air connection to the outside of the archipelago until 1 August. Two of the four water parks in the Algarve reopened on 17 Julyówith new rules including capping the number of visitors at 50% of the original capacity. Signs of security measures are posted at the entrance, including the mandatory use of masks in closed areas. The lawn is also strategically divided to follow all the rules of social distancing. Park staff advised to guide visitors to the least occupied areas. In an announcement on July 17, the government clarified rules on air traffic and airport management in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rules require passengers arriving in Portugal from the U.S. or any other non-EU country to have a negative RT-PCR test, which should have been carried out within 72 hours before flying. Non-compliance by airlines or airports will result in fines between Ä500 and Ä2,000. The rules are non-applicable to Portuguese nationals and anyone with a residency permit. Portugal is currently accepting flights without restriction from EU countries, Schengen area countries (Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and the UK. However, the government is discouraging non-essential trips abroad.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Portuguese and British authorities moved ahead with a re-evaluation of the UKís list of countries that holidaymakers can visit without having to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return to the UK.  Portugal was initially left off the list. The two governments are now in talks over adding Portugal in the coming weeks. Effective July 11, Portugalís airports will be ramping up controls on visitors, requiring proof of negative tests for COVID-19 before letting passengers through to their destinations. The new rules, however, only apply to nationals from non-EU countries: namely Brazil, the US, Angola, Mozambique, Cabo Verde and S„o TomÈ e PrincÌpe. Travellers from the UK who already spent 14-days in quarantine upon returning home will not face any further hurdles if they choose Portugal for holiday this summer. Non-Portuguese citizens and foreigners without residence in Portugal who do not have a negative test result for COVID-19 on arrival will have to take a test and pay for it at the airport. The latter would also be required to stay at their residences until the results arrive. Madeiraís Regional Government Council has authorised the reopening and use of playgrounds in the region as of July 18--with strict rules and safety rules in place. Face masks are mandatory for children over 10 years old along with their companion, and a distance of two metres must be maintained at the playground.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 1, the majority of mainland Portugal went into alert due to a rise in COVID-19 cases.  The Metropolitan Area of Lisbon (AML) entered the contingency state; 19 parishes in five municipalities within the AML remained at the calamity state. The restrictions imposed in mainland Portugal include strict observation of social distancing rules. Gatherings are limited to 20 people. However, within the AML, gatherings are limited to 10 people; most commercial establishments are required to close by 8pm and hypermarkets and supermarkets are required to close by 10pm. However, there is no closing time requirement for fuel supply services, pharmacies, offices and clinics. The five municipalities in the state of calamity have stricter restrictions: gatherings are limited to 5 people and fairs and markets remain closed. People are also allowed to leave only for the purposes of work, shopping, playing sports or providing assistance to family members. Despite the situation in Portugal, Spain reopened its borders with Portugal, both by land and air on July 1, with no swab test to be performed at the border. Portugal allows flights to and from its territory to countries of the Schengen Zone, the EU and the UK, effective July 3. However, travellers from Portuguese-speaking countries and the US are required to present proof of a negative COVID-19 test at the time of departure.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After entering phase three of deconfinement on June 15, the metropolitan area of Lisbon witnessed a spike in COVID-19 cases, causing new lockdown measures to be implemented within the region effective June 23.  These include a reduction in gatherings from 20 to 10 people and an 8pm curfew on commercial spaces, with the exception of restaurants and catering establishments providing home delivery, directly or through an intermediary, which can remain open till midnight. However, restaurants  are no longer allowed to serve drinks after the 8pm curfew, and drinking in public spaces outside of licensed esplanades is also prohibited. In a quest to support the regional economy and sector tourism in Southern Portugal, Ryanair announced the re-establishment of 37 routes to and from Faro, as of  July 1, as part of their summer 2020 schedule. Turismo de Portugal has also launched the ëClean & Safeí website on June 24, making it possible for tourists to leave reviews about the tourist developments they visit, in order to address public and safety concerns within those areas.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, the Metropolitan area of Lisbon entered phase three of deconfinement, a week after the rest of the country entered the third phase, following a reduction in the outbreak of COVID-19 cases. The same rules now apply in Lisbon as the rest of the country which includes the reopening of  large shopping centres, commercial establishments of over 400 square metres, leisure centres and water parks, along with an increase in gathering limit of 10 to 20 people. Even though Spain has announced the reopening of its borders to countries in the EUís Schengen area effective June 21, free movement to Portugal is only allowed starting July 1. Portugalís Covid-tracking app, ëstay awayí is due to be launched by the end of June. Through bluetooth technology, it aims to provide ërapid alertí to users who have been in contact with someone who has since been diagnosed with COVID-19. The science and technology minister has guaranteed that all data collected by the app will be anonymous, with the use of it voluntary. The minister expects a number of public and private institutions to recommend the use of the app ñ suggesting that while it will not be mandatory, people may end up being persuaded to download the software to satisfy requests in their day-to-day routines.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Portugalís national airline, TAP Air Portugal, resumed nonstop flights between Lisbon and Newark airport last week, following the completion of the countryís three-phase reopening strategy, with the formal  allowance of  E.U. citizens, except Spain and Italy, to enter via air on June 6. Although the countryís land border with Spain will remain closed until June 15, travellers arriving by air will not be required to quarantine but will have to face minimal health controls, in accordance to the countryís lockdown rules. Flights to and from selected countries such as the USA, UK, Canada and Brazil are scheduled to resume by mid June. Unlike some other countries now accepting tourists, mainland Portugal has discarded the requirement of a compulsory two week isolation period for the new arrivals. Upon experiencing a relatively COVID-19 free spring, hotels and other accommodations reopened last week, with local tourism boards awarding a new ëClean & Safeí badge to hotels and restaurants who have implemented new hygiene measures, including no buffets. Additionally, beaches reopened on June 6, with an app launched to help monitor capacity and aid in maintaining distance between sunbathers. As of June 9, the government announced its plan to progress to the state of contingency, effective July 1, from the state of calamity, which has been in place since May 3,  if cases continue to decrease.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 1, Portugal entered the third phase of its reopening strategy with several restrictions being lifted in most areas of the country with the exception of Lisbon, where different rules have been implemented regarding large gatherings. The civic self isolation rule  is no longer established, with meetings of up to 20 people allowed in all areas except the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon where the limit is only up to 10. Celebrations are permitted to be held with gatherings of 20 people allowed, followed by the guidelines determined by the Directorate-General for Health, namely within the capacity of religious ceremonies, family events (including weddings and baptisms, whether for civil or religious or other commemorative events) and corporate events held in spaces suitable for this purpose. The rule of mandatory teleworking is eliminated; however, daily and weekly shifts, with ëmirroredí teams are suggested to be adopted by the government. Stores located in shopping centres with an area greater than 400 m2 reopened with social distancing rules, except in the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon. Under respected guidelines defined by the Directorate-General for Health, most contact services also resumed operations, including casinos and tattoo services. Restaurants and food courts reopened in all areas except Lisbon, with unlimited capacity but with the maintenance of 1.5m distance between tables and separation barriers installed between the customers seated face to face. Outdoor cultural events, along with theatres, cinemas and auditoriums reopened with the occupation of all rows, mandatory application of masks  and space reserved between the spectators and the audience. The  infrastructures for the practice of individual sports also reopened along with gyms and  indoor/outdoor pools with proposed measures in place.Effective June 4, Portugalís national airline, TAP Air Portugal, is scheduled to resume nonstop flights between Lisbon and Newark airport, following the completion of the countryís three-phase reopening strategy, with the formal  allowance of  E.U. nationals, except Spain and Italy, to enter via air on June 6.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As part of the phase 3 deconfinement plan set out by the government,  malls and hotels are set to reopen with social distancing and COVID-19 protection measures in place, effective June 1st.  The guests at the hotel will not be able to check in to their rooms until 24 hours after the previous guests have left. Sunbeds will be given exclusively to hotel guests and buffets are unlikely to resume. Beaches will reopen by June 6th, with new rules in place, requiring sunbathers to stay 1.5 metres apart, with their umbrellas at  3 metres apart. The number of people on a beach will be strictly controlled, with a traffic light system in place to show the capacity available. This information will be made available in real time by the Portuguese Environment Agency, through an app. While the dates for reopening of hotels and beaches have already been set, nothing has been announced for the resumption of flights into the country, even though the PM did give a welcome back statement to tourists from May 22nd,  with precautionary measures at airports and no compulsory quarantine in place. Earlier this month, Portugal's flag carrier TAP did resume some of its international operations, with flights to London and Paris, but flights outside the EU are still temporarily suspended.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 15th, the PM announced the reopening of beaches, effective June 6th, with an adherence to the 1.5 metre distance rule within groups, booking of deck-chairs, and restrictions on group beach sports. Downloading of an app was also encouraged by the PM, which updates the beach-goers on the availability of  space at their beach of choice. The app will use real-time mobile data and numbers registered by beach businesses to establish an estimate of the number of people present at a beach, during a particular time. Followed by the stability in the number of  COVID-19 cases in Portugal, the Government also moved onto its second phase of deflation, effective May 18th, under which restaurants, cafes, and pastry shops, are now allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Terraces and street shops of up to 400 square metres, are allowed to reopen along with tourist establishments and local accommodations, with the ability to offer drinks and catering services to the public. High school students and day care centres reopened with new rules, such as the obligatory testing of all daycare workers, and the mandatory application of masks by all secondary school students. Visits to elderly homes with prior appointments are also permitted under authorisation, with the number of visits allowed per week limited to one 90 minute meeting. Museums across the country also reopened with on-site and online exhibitions and initiatives, with  safety standards such as the use of masks and social distancing measures as a prerequisite.</p>
