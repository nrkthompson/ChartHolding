  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has increased to 2,250 cases per day. On December 17, the Ontario Hospital Association called on the government to, at a minimum, “implement and robustly enforce a four-week lockdown in every public health unit with an infection rate of 40/100,000 population or higher.” The government is implementing a province-wide lockdown as of 12:01 a.m. on December 26 that will last for 28 days in the southern portions of the province (south of Sudbury) and 14 days in the northern parts. The lockdown will look similar to the province-wide shut-down in March, with only essential businesses being allowed to remain open. Under the province-wide lockdown, the winter break for students will be extended. This decision was made based on the COVID-19 modelling data, which projected that at the current rate of transmission, ICU admission would grow to 700 patients by the end of January. There are currently 261 patients infected with the disease in ICUs across the province.  The Ontario Hospital Association says that once the number surpasses 300, care for other medical needs will become nearly impossible.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has remained steady at 1,830 cases per day. Critical Care Services Ontario reported that, as of December 11, there were 251 COVID-19 patients in Ontario intensive care units and 152 people on ventilators. Doctors say they are seeing an average of 21 new COVID-19 ICU cases every day. As of December 14, York Region and Windsor-Essex joined Toronto and Peel Region in the lockdown-grey zone. The lockdown will last a minimum of 28 days, where bars and restaurants, personal care services, and non-essential retail stores close. The government also announced that Middlesex-London, Simcoe Muskoka and Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph moved into the red-control level; Eastern Ontario moved into the orange-restrict level; and Leeds, Greenville and Lanark moved into the yellow-protect level. Ontario’s first vaccination will be administered on December 15, prioritizing the first 3,000 doses for healthcare workers providing care in long-term care homes and other high-risk settings. The government expects to receive 2.4 million vaccines in the first quarter of 2021 from Pfizer and Moderna.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has increased to 1,820 cases per day and the province saw record-high case numbers for December 5, 6 and 7. Three more regions in Ontario are facing tougher public health restrictions as of December 7, but none are joining Toronto or Peel at the "lockdown" level. Middlesex-London and Thunder Bay are now in the Orange-Restrict level, while Haliburton, Kawartha, and Pine Ridge are moving to the Yellow-Protect level. The differences between the levels are mostly related to the number of people in food and drink establishments. For example, the number of customers allowed in restaurants is unlimited in Yellow-Protect, 50 customers in Orange-Restrict, and ten in Red-Control.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has increased slightly to 1,550 cases per day. On November 23, Toronto and Peel Region moved into "lockdown" for a minimum of 28 days -- with new restrictions including bans on indoor private gatherings, curbside pick-up for restaurants and non-essential retail stores, and closure of personal care services, casinos and bingo halls. Windsor-Essex is moving into the red "control" zone, while Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit is moving to the orange "restrict" zone.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has remained stable at around 1,400 cases per day. Nearly 80% of cases reported in recent days are from regions in red zones. This past week hospitalizations have increased by 22% and intensive care admissions have risen by 50%. On November 20, the premier announced that Toronto and Peel Region are moving into "lockdown" effective at 12:01 am. November 23. The shutdown will last a minimum of 28 days, equal to two incubation periods for COVID-19. The province says it will fine people $750 for violating public-health rules. The new restrictions for Toronto and Peel include: no indoor private gatherings; outdoor gatherings limited to 10 people; restaurants limited to take-out and delivery only; gyms closed; non-essential retail and malls limited to curbside pickup; personal care services, casinos and bingo halls closed; and post-secondary institutions moved mostly to virtual instruction. Schools, pharmacies, medical clinics, and grocery stores remain open. Durham and Waterloo regions are moving into the red "control" zones. Huron-Perth, Simcoe-Muskoka, southwestern Ontario and Windsor are moving to the orange "restrict" zone.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has reached a record high of 1400 cases per day, as the figure continues to exponentially increase. On November 3, the government introduced a colour-tiered system that places regions in different sector-specific zones: Green (Prevent and Standard Measures), Yellow (Protect and Strengthened Measures), Orange (Restrict and Intermediate Measures), Red (Control and Stringent Measures), and Lockdown (Maximum Measures). The government has been heavily criticized for its framework, with many health experts saying it does not go far enough to protect Ontarians. In an update on November 13, the province lowered its COVID-19 framework threshold, adding York, Halton and Hamilton to the Red Zone. Even though the Red Zone allows indoor dining with a maximum of ten customers, many municipalities are adding restrictions of their own, such as banning indoor dining.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has reached a record high of 1,070 cases per day, and the figure is no longer plateauing. This week, the Ontario government released a new color-coded approach to introducing restrictions across the province. Health restrictions in red zones, the most restrictive at the moment, include limiting indoor dining capacity and limiting gyms to ten patrons. In comparison, modified Stage 2 had shut all indoor dining. As a result, Peel Region asked that it remain under modified Stage 2, similar to Toronto; the province rejected this request. In response, Peel Region is bringing in its own directives, which are stricter than those required for red zones. Ontario says it wants to build capacity for up to 100,000 tests for the novel coronavirus each day by mid-December. The province has never surpassed its current capacity of about 50,000, let alone approached its mid-November target of 68,000.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has climbed to 918 cases per day, but the figure appears to be plateauing. This plateau was expected given the public health measures put in place three weeks ago. Toronto, Peel Region, Ottawa and York Region are currently in a modified Stage 2, which forces indoor dining, movie theatres, some personal care services, bingo halls and gyms to close. The 28-day period for these restrictions in Toronto, Peel and Ottawa is set to expire at 11:59 p.m. on November 6, and in York a week later. Consequently, the premier has asked public health experts to advise him on a plan to begin easing restrictions in a way that safely allows businesses to start reopening without negatively impacting Ontario’s epidemiological situation. The premier is facing fierce internal backlash over his modified Stage 2 restrictions after a detailed sector-by-sector breakdown pointed to schools, daycares, long-term care and retirement homes, which have remained open, as the primary source of outbreaks.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has climbed to 857 cases per day, and the province reported a record 1,042 new COVID-19 cases on October 25, marking the first time cases have ever surpassed 1,000. The minister of health indicated that the increase is likely a result of Thanksgiving gatherings, and that Ontario’s numbers should be plateauing this week as a result of public health measures put in place 2 weeks ago. The government remains committed to taking swift actions in closing certain regions to keep schools across the province open. Despite resistance from members of the government, Halton Region is expected to join Toronto, Ottawa, York Region and Peel in modified stage 2, where indoor dining, including bars and nightclubs, gyms, cinemas, interactive exhibitions, performing arts centres, casinos, bingo halls, and some personal care services are closed for at least 28 days.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has slightly increased to 745 cases per day; the number of active cases have begun decreasing as the number of recoveries increase. On October 19, York Region will join Toronto, Peel Region and Ottawa in Stage 2, due to a 49% case rate increase and a doubling of the hospitalization rate within one week in the region. Accordingly, York residents will see indoor dining (including bars and nightclubs), gyms, cinemas, interactive exhibitions, performing arts centres, casinos, bingo halls, and some personal care services closed for at least 28 days. The gathering limit is 10 people indoors, and 25 people outdoors across all sectors, including religious ceremonies, weddings, conferences, and private gatherings. Ontario is urging people to limit trips outside of the home, and some restaurants and businesses in Stage 3 regions are banning Ontarians from Stage 2 regions from entering their facilities.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 12, Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has slightly increased to 705 cases per day. However, health experts warn that case counts were likely "unreliable" in Ontario following the change in testing from walk-in to appointment based. Regardless, there is still a significant backlog in testing. On October 9, the Ontario government introduced a modified Stage 2 to combat the increase in cases in Toronto, Peel Region and Ottawa. Effective 12:01 a.m. on October 10, indoor dining. including bars and nightclubs, gyms, cinemas, interactive exhibitions, performing arts centres, casinos, bingo halls, and personal care services where face coverings must be removed will be closed for at least 28 days. The government is also enforcing the gathering limit of 10 indoor and 25 outdoor across all sectors, including religious ceremonies, weddings, conferences, and private gatherings. Ontario is now urging people to limit trips outside of their home, except for essential purposes such as work where it is not possible to work from home, school, grocery shopping, medical appointments, and outdoor healthy physical activity.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 6, Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has increased by a third to 624 cases per day. There has been a significant backlog in testing due to an exponential increase of cases and community transmission, causing the government to suspend walk-in testing across the province in favor of an appointment based system. Experts say that this transition will cause an artificial drop in confirmed cases, as healthcare providers cope with the changing rules. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health said that additional restrictions may be coming to regional hotspots. As part of the government’s Fall Preparedness Plan, the government has invested money into supporting public health and long term care homes. Casinos opened across Ontario on September 28.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 27, Ontario’s 7-day rolling average has slowed down its rapid increase to around 426 cases per day. On September 24, nearly 40 doctors signed an open letter calling for the government to restrict non-essential businesses and activities that cause people to gather, such as dine-in restaurants and bars, gyms, theatres, nightclubs and churches. According to a leaked government plan, the Premier wants to avoid imposing lockdown-style measures to combat a second wave of COVID-19, but is prepared to take "targeted action" by closing certain higher-risk businesses. Accordingly, on September 25, the government imposed a limit on alcohol sales at bars and restaurants between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., and is requiring all establishments to close by midnight. Additionally, all strip clubs across the province must be closed. The Ontario Restaurant Hotel & Motel Association, warned that closing bars earlier would see patrons head to private dwellings to continue drinking, without bar staff on hand to enforce physical distancing or other public health measures.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 20, Ontarioís 7-day rolling average is 335 cases per day, which is double what it was ten days ago. As a result, the Ontario government reintroduced restrictions on gathering. Across Ontario, and for the next 28 days, private, unmonitored gatherings will be limited to ten people indoors and 25 people outdoors. Events held in staffed facilities are excluded -- such as movie theatres, schools, places of worship, gyms and convention centres. 70% of Saturday's cases were among people under 40. The official opposition NDP criticized the government over class sizes.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Ontarioís 7-day rolling average is 161 cases per day, which is the highest it's been since July. As a result, the Ontario government has hit "a pause of four weeks" before the province considers any further loosening of public health measures or further reopening of businesses, facilities or organizations. Activities that have been paused include expanding social circles, expanding gathering sizes and further increases in the number of people allowed to attend sports events. Premier Doug Ford says he'll support Toronto's move to shut down the city's bars if Mayor John Tory decides to do so; Ford says that it is a municipal issue and does not want to implement a province-wide ban. As schools reopen this week and next throughout the province, the government will publicly report all cases of COVID-19 after being pushed by the opposition to do so; outbreaks constitute two or more confirmed cases amongst students/staff in a school within a 14-day period.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 24, Ontario reported more than 100 new cases of COVID-19 for the fourth day in a row, as the number of active cases creeped up. Majority of the provinceís new cases are among individuals between the ages of 20 and 50. Late last month, the provincial government released its back-to-school plan, which includes elementary students returning to the classroom full-time with regular class sizes. Students up to grade 8 will be with one cohort for the entire day, with enhanced health and safety protocols in place. Premier Doug Ford said he would close schools again if Ontario is hit with a second wave of COVID-19. Halton District School Board chair AndrÈa Grebenc said that the governmentís messaging about school reopening this month has been difficult to follow. The Ministry pointed to repeated assurances from Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Williams that the school plan meets his grade for safety--due, in large part, to the significant declines in community transmission of COVID-19 this summer.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 12, all regions in Ontario are now in Stage 3, as the province continues to report a 7-day rolling average of less than 100 cases per day. Sixty-five per cent of cases were found in people aged 39 or younger. A new poll for the Toronto Star found that four out of five Ontarians support making it mandatory to wear masks indoors to curb the spread of COVID-19:  63% of respondents ìstrongly supportî compulsory indoor masks, while only 6% ìstrongly opposeî such a rule. As September approaches, most COVID-19 related news concerns school reopening plans. The provincial government has instructed school boards to come up with reasonable plans based on guidelines from the Ministry of Education. The government rejected the Toronto District School Boardís (TDSB) proposals for reopening--saying the boardís plan did not give students enough time in class. A TDSB spokesperson said the government took issue with the board's plan to reduce the average size of classrooms to 15 students for kindergarten to grade three and to 20 students for grades four to eight.  The plan would have seen the board hire 200 additional teachers at a cost of $20 million.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Last week, Ontario reported less than 100 cases a day for 7 days. This trend was encouraging--especially since all regions except Windsor-Essex advanced to Stage 3 on July 31. There are currently 49 patients infected with the virus in Ontario hospitals. Of those patients, 25 are being treated in the intensive care unit and 14 are on a ventilator. Windsor-Essex will advance to Stage 3 on August 12. The government's back-to-school plan is largely in keeping with expert recommendations on cohorting teens, revising high school schedules, mandatory mask use, testing, isolation and sustained surveillance. However, the plan has received criticism over its ability to achieve physical distancing among students at the elementary level.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Case counts have slightly decreased in the province over the last week. Nevertheless, the Windsor-Essex area will remain in phase two due to the current transmission rate. Ontarioís Landlord and Tenant Board is set to begin processing thousands of eviction applications on August 4, amid pressure from tenant advocacy groups trying to extend a ban on evictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After facing criticism over reopening bars and indoor dining too early, the Ontario government implemented additional contact tracing measures at these facilities on July 31. Bars and restaurants (and also tour boat operators) in Ontario are required to keep client logs for a period of 30 days and to disclose the logs should a case be detected. However, some stakeholders are concerned that this is a breach of privacy by private establishments and that the government should use the COVID Alert app instead. Additional details about the planned reopening of schools were released this week.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Seven more regions, including parts of the Greater Toronto, Hamilton, Niagara areas, advanced to Stage 3 on July 24. Those areas can now enjoy indoor dining and recreation, gyms and an increase to gathering limits (up to 50 indoors). The remaining areas (Peel, Toronto and Windsor-Essex) will receive an update on July 29, based on their metrics. Ontario has seen an increase in its daily case count average this week, with a majority (around 66%) of people under 40. Premier Doug Ford is concerned about this, though indoor dining and bars are open in Stage 3. After a three-week delay, the Canadian Digital Service began beta testing of the tracing app on July 23 in Ontario.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the province reported some of the lowest case counts since March, Ontario advanced to Stage 3 with a regional approach. On July 17, most Ontarian regions, except the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton, Niagara and Windsor, were allowed to reopen further. On July 20, Premier Ford announced that all regions, except for Toronto, Peel Region and Windsor Essex, would advance to Stage 3 on July 24. In Stage 3, indoor gathering limits increase from 10 to 50 people, while outdoor gathering limits increase to a maximum of 100 people. Although cinemas are allowed to open, Cineplex Entertainment, Canadaís largest chain of movie theatres, announced it did not plan to resume operation immediately in regions entering Stage 3. Critics say it is because the government has not thought of a thorough reopening policy for theatres that would keep customers safe while allowing businesses to make profits. Additionally, all restaurants and bars, except buffets, can resume indoor service, and gyms can reopen. Ontarioís official opposition is criticizing the government for reopening bars before having a clear in-person school plan for the fall. On July 17, the Ontario Medical Association called on the Ford government to rethink opening indoor bars because evidence from other jurisdictions suggested that the reopening of bars carried a significant risk. Most municipalities in Ontario continue to enforce face coverings in indoor establishments.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the 7-day average of cases continues to decrease in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford announced on July 13 that the province will adopt a regional approach moving into Stage 3 of its reopening strategy. Health Minister Christine Elliott indicated that short of providing a vaccine, Ontario will remain in Stage 3 (within ìPhase 2î) for the foreseeable future. The first regions to advance to Stage 3 on July 17 are mostly rural, where nearly all businesses can reopen with hygienic controls, except for high-risk ones including amusement/water parks, buffet-style food services, and nightclubs. This past week, many municipalities across the province have enacted bylaws enforcing face coverings inside public spaces, such as shops and other establishments. Some Greater Toronto Area mayors had called on Premier Ford to legislate face coverings, but the province lacks the capacity to enforce mask bylaws. After a few instances of aggressive non-compliance were widely publicized, legal experts say that--short of calling police on customers who do not comply--businesses may find they have little power to enforce the policy.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although there was a slight spike in cases due to rigorous testing of migrant workers, Ontario reported fewer than 200 daily cases this past week. Outbreaks remain concentrated among long-term care homes, farms, and manufacturing plants. Even though Torontoís Humber River Hospital is reporting zero ICU patients with COVID-19 for the first time since mid-March, doctors and nurses are still preparing for an ëinevitableí second wave. Ontario was to be the first province to try a contact tracing app, which was due to launch on July 2; however, this date has been pushed back indefinitely. Many experts say that this app, which follows the Apple-Google model, could prevent a major second wave because it can identify transmission quicker. This week, some school boards began surveying parents for their input on reopening. Ottawa-Carleton District School Board has proposed a model that would have half of the students attending school on Monday and Tuesday; Wednesday would be a day for deep cleaning of schools; and on Thursday and Friday, the other half of the students would return.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 26, all health regions in Ontario, except for portions of Windsor-Essex, are now at phase 2 of the government's reopening plan. In this phase, restaurants and bars can reopen for outdoor service, along with barbers, hair and nail salons, and child care centres. Gatherings of up to ten people are permitted, within social circles. Some municipalities are preparing to run summer camps throughout the province, which are due to begin around July. After two weeks in phase 2, a nail salon in Kingston experienced an outbreak, requiring all clients who visited the salon between June 12 and 24 to self-isolate. Premier Doug Ford has cautioned against enacting mandatory face mask laws, saying that it should be at each municipality's discretion as advised by the Chief Medical Officer.</p>
