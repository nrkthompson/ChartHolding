  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although there was a slight spike in cases due to rigorous testing of migrant workers, Ontario reported fewer than 200 daily cases this past week. Outbreaks remain concentrated among long-term care homes, farms, and manufacturing plants. Even though Toronto’s Humber River Hospital is reporting zero ICU patients with COVID-19 for the first time since mid-March, doctors and nurses are still preparing for an ‘inevitable’ second wave. Ontario was to be the first province to try a contact tracing app, which was due to launch on July 2; however, this date has been pushed back indefinitely. Many experts say that this app, which follows the Apple-Google model, could prevent a major second wave because it can identify transmission quicker. This week, some school boards began surveying parents for their input on reopening. Ottawa-Carleton District School Board has proposed a model that would have half of the students attending school on Monday and Tuesday; Wednesday would be a day for deep cleaning of schools; and on Thursday and Friday, the other half of the students would return.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 26, all health regions in Ontario, except for portions of Windsor-Essex, are now at phase 2 of the government's reopening plan. In this phase, restaurants and bars can reopen for outdoor service, along with barbers, hair and nail salons, and child care centres. Gatherings of up to ten people are permitted, within social circles. Some municipalities are preparing to run summer camps throughout the province, which are due to begin around July. After two weeks in phase 2, a nail salon in Kingston experienced an outbreak, requiring all clients who visited the salon between June 12 and 24 to self-isolate. Premier Doug Ford has cautioned against enacting mandatory face mask laws, saying that it should be at each municipality's discretion as advised by the Chief Medical Officer.</p>
