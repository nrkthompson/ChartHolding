  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Seven more regions, including parts of the Greater Toronto, Hamilton, Niagara areas, advanced to Stage 3 on July 24. Those areas can now enjoy indoor dining and recreation, gyms and an increase to gathering limits (up to 50 indoors). The remaining areas (Peel, Toronto and Windsor-Essex) will receive an update on July 29, based on their metrics. Ontario has seen an increase in its daily case count average this week, with a majority (around 66%) of people under 40. Premier Doug Ford is concerned about this, though indoor dining and bars are open in Stage 3. After a three-week delay, the Canadian Digital Service began beta testing of the tracing app on July 23 in Ontario.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the province reported some of the lowest case counts since March, Ontario advanced to Stage 3 with a regional approach. On July 17, most Ontarian regions, except the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton, Niagara and Windsor, were allowed to reopen further. On July 20, Premier Ford announced that all regions, except for Toronto, Peel Region and Windsor Essex, would advance to Stage 3 on July 24. In Stage 3, indoor gathering limits increase from 10 to 50 people, while outdoor gathering limits increase to a maximum of 100 people. Although cinemas are allowed to open, Cineplex Entertainment, Canada’s largest chain of movie theatres, announced it did not plan to resume operation immediately in regions entering Stage 3. Critics say it is because the government has not thought of a thorough reopening policy for theatres that would keep customers safe while allowing businesses to make profits. Additionally, all restaurants and bars, except buffets, can resume indoor service, and gyms can reopen. Ontario’s official opposition is criticizing the government for reopening bars before having a clear in-person school plan for the fall. On July 17, the Ontario Medical Association called on the Ford government to rethink opening indoor bars because evidence from other jurisdictions suggested that the reopening of bars carried a significant risk. Most municipalities in Ontario continue to enforce face coverings in indoor establishments.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the 7-day average of cases continues to decrease in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford announced on July 13 that the province will adopt a regional approach moving into Stage 3 of its reopening strategy. Health Minister Christine Elliott indicated that short of providing a vaccine, Ontario will remain in Stage 3 (within “Phase 2”) for the foreseeable future. The first regions to advance to Stage 3 on July 17 are mostly rural, where nearly all businesses can reopen with hygienic controls, except for high-risk ones including amusement/water parks, buffet-style food services, and nightclubs. This past week, many municipalities across the province have enacted bylaws enforcing face coverings inside public spaces, such as shops and other establishments. Some Greater Toronto Area mayors had called on Premier Ford to legislate face coverings, but the province lacks the capacity to enforce mask bylaws. After a few instances of aggressive non-compliance were widely publicized, legal experts say that--short of calling police on customers who do not comply--businesses may find they have little power to enforce the policy.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although there was a slight spike in cases due to rigorous testing of migrant workers, Ontario reported fewer than 200 daily cases this past week. Outbreaks remain concentrated among long-term care homes, farms, and manufacturing plants. Even though Toronto’s Humber River Hospital is reporting zero ICU patients with COVID-19 for the first time since mid-March, doctors and nurses are still preparing for an ‘inevitable’ second wave. Ontario was to be the first province to try a contact tracing app, which was due to launch on July 2; however, this date has been pushed back indefinitely. Many experts say that this app, which follows the Apple-Google model, could prevent a major second wave because it can identify transmission quicker. This week, some school boards began surveying parents for their input on reopening. Ottawa-Carleton District School Board has proposed a model that would have half of the students attending school on Monday and Tuesday; Wednesday would be a day for deep cleaning of schools; and on Thursday and Friday, the other half of the students would return.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of June 26, all health regions in Ontario, except for portions of Windsor-Essex, are now at phase 2 of the government's reopening plan. In this phase, restaurants and bars can reopen for outdoor service, along with barbers, hair and nail salons, and child care centres. Gatherings of up to ten people are permitted, within social circles. Some municipalities are preparing to run summer camps throughout the province, which are due to begin around July. After two weeks in phase 2, a nail salon in Kingston experienced an outbreak, requiring all clients who visited the salon between June 12 and 24 to self-isolate. Premier Doug Ford has cautioned against enacting mandatory face mask laws, saying that it should be at each municipality's discretion as advised by the Chief Medical Officer.</p>
