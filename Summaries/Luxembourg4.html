      After the closure of all educational institutes announced in March, the potential use of a video-surveillance platform was announced by universities in Luxembourg, for their upcoming exam session. However, concerns were raised by student associations over fundamental rights and privacy, following which the University of Luxembourg announced on June 5, that they are yet to make a final decision. The university stated that it will assure that the software used, fulfills all criteria when it comes to data protection. However, because this complex process could not be completed at such short notice, this particular instrument is highly unlikely to be used at this moment. Instead, the university will make use of different approaches such as oral exams or tests which students can also take home with them.73While the government has declared an end to the state of emergency, effective June 24, all COVID-19 measures are likely to stay in place until further notice.74 Effective June 10, all outdoor playgrounds reopened without any further restrictions. Children below the age of 13 are no longer required to wear a mask while being in public, but they remain mandatory on school premises. Summer activities for children can be reinstated, but groups should not exceed 50 participants. Gatherings of people below 20 are no longer under any governmental restriction. Nonetheless, wearing masks and keeping distance is still in place. In restaurants, up to 10 people can now sit together at a table, and individual sports and competitions resume with no physical contact.75
