      Starting on July 13, Finland will no longer require travellers from EU countries with an infection rate of fewer than 8 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks to quarantine themselves on arrival. A dozen EU countries currently meet the criteria to be eligible, but the government will decide on a final list by July 10. The government has also called off its specific recommendations for those over the age of 70, saying that all age groups should practice good hygiene and social distancing but that lockdown measures for the elderly were no longer necessary. Additionally, the government will lift its recommendation to work from home on August 1, though companies should continue to accommodate those who cannot return to the office.

      The Finnish government ended the country’s state of emergency this week after over three months. The normal legislative process will now resume and the government will stop issuing executive orders. The government will issue amendments to existing laws to Parliament in August that will enable them to react to a potential second wave without resorting to emergency law in the future. Outdoor events of more than 500 people will be permitted to take place, with certain restrictions, on July 1. Organizers will no longer need government approval for indoor or outdoor events of that size starting on August 1. Finland will allow restaurants to operate at 75% capacity and resume normal working hours and alcohol sales on June 22. Minister of Science and Culture Hanna Kosonen said that if the pandemic situation continues to improve, the country will lift all remaining restrictions by October 1.

      The Finnish government will lift all border restrictions for Nordic and Baltic countries, excluding Sweden, from June 15. The Foreign Ministry continues to advise against unnecessary international travel, and has said that border restrictions to the rest of the Schengen area will remain in place until at least July 14. Additionally, the government announced that large public events of more than 500 people will be permitted to take place starting on July 1, subject to certain restrictions. PM Marin has said that the government is looking to propose amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act to allow them to introduce lockdown measures as fast as possible in the event of a second wave of the virus. Minister of Justice Anna-Maja Henriksson has said that the government is hopeful that many of the remaining restrictions will be lifted in the coming weeks.

      All restrictions on domestic leisure travel were lifted this week as the school year came to an end in Finland. The limits were lifted despite public health officials warning that domestic leisure travel should be strongly discouraged just a few days prior to the announcement. Significant restrictions on eateries, entertainment and gatherings were removed on June 1, with much of Finnish society now reopen. While normal public and private gatherings are now limited to 50 people (previous limit was 10), some mass events of up to 500 people will be permitted if the organizers commit to following social distancing protocols. The government will continue to discuss its coronavirus exit strategy with opposition parties, with the next update expected before June 21. Finland plans to launch its voluntary coronavirus tracing app in August, though the government has said that it will not replace traditional tracing methods conducted by local governments. The government plans to amend its Basic Education Act to allow for more flexibility in moving between in-person schooling and remote learning methods. The amendment would allow for regional variation and temporary changes to learning plans if the pandemic worsens in the next school year.

      As some European countries have offered tourists the chance to be tested at the airport upon their arrival to avoid a two week quarantine, Finland has indicated that it will not do the same. Finnish authorities have said that they concur with the European Centre for Disease Control that airport tests can often be ineffective, and the low number of positive cases that will result from this program are not worth the high costs. Public health officials in Finland have continued to advise against domestic leisure travel for the time being, even as most lockdown restrictions will be lifted over the next few weeks. The Constitutional Committee of Finland has said that the country’s restaurant restrictions need to be revised before their scheduled opening on June 1st, with the restrictions being in place for too long and that they should be imposed regionally, not across the board. The government has doubled the number of foreign agricultural workers that will be allowed into the country this summer (from 4500 to 9000) after many large farms stated that they would not be able to complete their harvest in time with such a small number.

      Finnish schools reopened this week for all students, though a small number opted to stay home for the rest of the school year. Outbreaks were reported at numerous schools across the country, infecting both students and staff. While the affected classes were sent home for distance learning, the schools remained open after hygiene procedures were initiated. Finland has eased restrictions for those who are over 70 years old, saying that they are able to see their relatives as long as they maintain a distance of two metres and wear a mask. The Finnish government outlined the regulations that will be in place for restaurants and bars after they are allowed to open on June 1st. Each establishment must stop serving alcohol at 10pm, and is limited to half of their normal capacity for the time being. Leaders in the hospitality industry have voiced some pushback to these policies, saying that a capacity that is 75% normal would give restaurant owners more breathing room on their expenses, which are expected to be paid in full.
