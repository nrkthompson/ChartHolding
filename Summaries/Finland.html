  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases in Finland has remained relatively stable over the past week. However, public health officials have expressed concern that the true spread is much higher due to low testing figures and a rising positivity rate. The government announced that they will ramp up border testing and prohibit non-essential travel into the country on January 27. Only work-related and urgent family-related travel will be permitted until at least February 25. The minister of social services also urged Finns to avoid all international travel. Public health officials said that the large-scale vaccination program for the general public will be delayed from February due to AstraZeneca production issues, with no timetable set for a new start date. Public health officials also said they were considering halving the second dose of the vaccine following a study that showed even small booster shots were effective at increasing immunity.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of confirmed cases in Finland has remained stable over the past few weeks, with most cases concentrated in the Helsinki area. Recent reports suggested that the prime minister has been looking to introduce further travel restrictions and increase testing capacity at border entry points, but they are running into legal issues. In order to introduce these restrictions, the government may implement another state of emergency. The city of Helsinki will begin testing passengers on ferries arriving from Estonia, though it will remain optional for all arrivals. A vaccine is being developed in Finland that is meant to inoculate fur farm animals in an attempt to provide safeguards against another potential mink-borne mutation. The interim minister of education said that the government is considering moving all primary schools nationwide to distance learning due to the increasing spread of the UK variant of COVID-19.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The infection rate in Finland has remained relatively stable over the past week. Public health officials are optimistic that the infection rate in Helsinki has declined, though they emphasized that restrictions should not be lifted as it remains the most affected region in the country. The prime minister said that she is not currently looking to re-introduce the emergency powers her government had during the first wave of the pandemic, but the government will continue to discuss the situation as it evolves. Finland has banned all passenger flights from the UK for at least the next two weeks due to the discovery of a new highly contagious strain of COVID-19. Vaccinations in Finland are set to begin on December 27, as in other EU countries. The first batch of vaccines will arrive close to Christmas.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finland reported 840 new cases of COVID-19 on December 11 in the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. Restaurants in Lapland must stop selling alcohol by 10 pm effective December 11, and national restaurant restrictions have been extended until the end of February. Hospitals in Helsinki have had to reduce their non-urgent care capacity due to the rising number of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Public health officials have recommended that all those who wish to visit their elderly relatives during the holidays should complete a 10-day quarantine period before doing so. There have been a number of reports of healthcare staff being forced to go back to work despite not having completed their quarantine period after being exposed to an infected person. A patient whose case was connected to the staff has since died.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of daily new cases has rapidly increased in Finland over the past two weeks, though hospitalizations have fallen slightly. Most Finnish provinces are in the accelerating or spreading phase of the pandemic. The capacity and operating hours of all bars and restaurants have been limited. Local officials in Helsinki have banned hospital visits except for palliative care, children, and expectant mothers. Public health officials have warned the public that the country is facing a COVID-19 testing shortage and they no longer have the capacity to test asymptomatic people. Authorities announced that healthcare workers will be vaccinated in January, followed by at-risk groups in February.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finland reported 618 new cases of COVID-19 on November 28 in the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The prime minister said that there are no plans to implement a nationwide mandatory mask policy or institute a national state of emergency. However, the government issued a recommendation to avoid close-contact leisure activities and said further regional restrictions would be implemented. All state-owned slot machines and gambling facilities will be closed in any region deemed to be in the Ôcommunity transmissionÕ phase of the pandemic. Local officials in Helsinki and the Tampere region announced that all youth centres, cultural venues, and indoor sports facilities must close. All leisure activities for adults in both regions have been suspended. Upper secondary schools in Helsinki have switched to online learning. The public gathering limit in both regions has been lowered to 10 people; private gatherings are not recommended.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finland reported 456 new cases of COVID-19 on November 20 -- the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. Most cases are concentrated in the Helsinki region. Public health officials announced that the region has moved to the Òcommunity transmission phase.Ó A number of new restrictions have been introduced in the region, with the gathering limit at public indoor events reduced to 20 people, adult team sports suspended for the next three weeks, and swimming pools limited to 50% capacity. A recommendation to limit private gatherings to 10 people was also issued. The government is expected to introduce further restrictions on Òlate-night cafesÓ this week due to concerns over crowding. Finland extended their travel restrictions for another month, with border checks for all arrivals coming from within the Schengen area. The government is looking to implement a mandatory test-and-quarantine scheme that would replace the border checks, but the law has not been finalized.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finland has reported around 1,700 new cases of COVID-19 over the past week, around 450 more than the week before. There are currently 80 hospitalizations in the country, with 13 in the ICU. Public health officials in Helsinki have issued a recommendation that masks be worn at all times in schools. The government is considering allowing travel from countries with up to twice the infection rate of Finland, though this would not take effect until at least the spring. No European countries would currently meet this criteria. In the meantime, Finnish officials are likely to extend their tough travel restrictions, including border checks for all arrivals. The minister of agriculture said that there is no need for additional restrictions on foreign agricultural workers -- despite a recent outbreak that infected 64 people at a farm in PieksŠmŠki. Public health officials said that they are considering three vaccine candidates, which will be free for all residents upon its release.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of November 9, the two-week average of new cases in Finland is 50 per 100,000 people. Public health officials have said that the COVID-19 infection rate is on a slight upward trend in the country, though the situation is much less dire than in the rest of Europe. Contact tracing has been able to find the origin of 60% of the new cases -- an improvement over the past few weeks. Most new infections have been found in young people. The mutated strain of COVID-19 found in minks in Denmark has prompted Finnish officials to ramp up the testing of animals at fur farms around the country. Testing will commence at all farms within the next few weeks.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finland reported 344 new cases of COVID-19 on October 31 in the countryÕs largest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. Despite the record-setting daily increase, the number of new cases over the past week has remained relatively stable compared to the last few weeks. Public health officials said that the stability is encouraging, as testing has been ramped up and contact tracing has improved. FinlandÕs contact tracing app has reached 2.5 million downloads, approximately 45% of the Finnish population. Restrictions will be implemented in five regions this week, including a ban on the sale of alcohol after 10 pm. Bars and nightclubs will be limited to half-capacity and restaurants are limited to 75% capacity. Regional officials in Helsinki have mandated the use of masks at all indoor sports facilities, though they are not required during physical activity or for those under the age of 15, and health exemptions apply.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The infection rate in Finland has been relatively stable over the past week, with a similar number of cases reported as the week before. The government announced that nightclubs and bars will only be permitted to operate at 50% capacity, while restaurants and cafes can return to 75% capacity. The restrictions only apply in regions in the ÔacceleratingÕ phase of the pandemic. The government is also finalizing its design of a testing-based entry model. Travellers will need to provide a negative test result from their country of origin if they will be in Finland for up to three days. Travellers who will be in the country for 3 to 7 days will need to take another test while they are in Finland, but will not need to quarantine. Restrictions for those who intend to stay in the country for longer than a week will be made on a case-by-case basis. If the epidemiological situation in a travellerÕs country of origin is better than it is in Finland, then no test result will be required at all.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 19, the two-week average of new cases in Finland is 49.2 per 100,000 people, nearly double the rate from two weeks ago. The government is looking to implement changes to the countryÕs infectious diseases law that would make it easier for regional authorities to impose new restrictions. Critics of the proposal said that they fear the changes may lead to misuse that would limit rights and freedoms. The prime minister said that imposing a national state of emergency would be a Òlast resortÓ for the government. Regional authorities in Helsinki have advised that people who  work in-person must wear a mask at their workplace. The government has recommended that all those who can work from home should continue to do so until at least the end of the year, and will ban public events in all regions where the infection rate is considered to be accelerating.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 9, the two-week average of new cases in Finland is 34 per 100,000 people after having doubled in the past week. As a result, the prime minister said that the government would consider implementing new restrictions next week, including lowering the gathering limit and moving some schools to distance learning. The new restrictions may only apply to certain regions or may be recommendations where the final decision rests with regional authorities. Public health officials said they may require a traveller to present a negative COVID-19 test result from their home country and then take another test upon their arrival in Finland; if both tests are negative, the traveller would be able to travel throughout Finland restriction-free for up to a week. Opposition MPs have accused the health minister of presenting misleading information about masks to Finns throughout the pandemic, and have called for a confidence vote on her leadership to be held.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a rise in infections throughout Finland, public health officials have recommended the use of masks nationwide when social distancing cannot be maintained, when accessing local services, and when taking public transit. Beginning October 8, , bars and restaurants across the country must stop serving alcohol by midnight and close by 1am. The restrictions are stricter in the Helsinki region, where bars and restaurants must stop serving alcohol at 10pm and close by 11pm. Bars and restaurants in regions considered to be in the ÔaccelerationÕ stage of the pandemic will also be limited to half capacity. Nearly 200 cases of COVID-19 in recent weeks have been connected to the food and drink industry, with more than 40 cases connected to a single bar. Local officials in some regions are considering implementing stricter restrictions than are currently in place nationally. The Finnish government has survived its first vote of no-confidence since the beginning of the pandemic. Opposition parties brought the motion forward due to what they viewed as ÒirresponsibleÓ economic policy. All partners in the governing coalition voted to retain confidence, giving the government a clear majority of parliamentarians present during the vote.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finland re-introduced travel restrictions on Estonia, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Germany, and Slovakia, effective September 28. The only countries in Europe that are now exempted from restrictions are Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Poland and San Marino. Work-related travel to Sweden, Estonia, and Norway will continue to be permitted. Starting on October 1, travellers who wish to avoid the full quarantine period will have the option to present a negative COVID-19 test upon their arrival, enter isolation for at least three days, and then take another test. If they present a negative result, they will be permitted to leave quarantine early. The infection rates in some regions of Finland surpass the countryÕs foreign travel restrictions, though no localized lockdowns are currently expected. Public health officials in Finland will recommend the use of masks in indoor public places on a region-by-region basis. As of September 28, only two rural areas are exempt from the mask recommendation. Finland is expected to introduce new restrictions on the operating hours of restaurants and bars following government discussions on September 29 as a result of a number of clusters linked to the industry in recent days.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective September 19, Finland eased travel restrictions on all EU countries with an infection rate of less than 25 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks. The Finnish government will continue internal border controls in order to monitor the implementation of a test-based entry model, which is expected to come into effect in November. Travellers from countries with infection rates higher than the limit will be subject to a mandatory COVID-19 test upon their arrival. Country specific travel restrictions will remain in place until at least October 18 and Finnish authorities will continue to carry out weekly assessments of the COVID-19 situation around the world. As a result of the change, non-essential travel from Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Cyprus, and Poland was permitted effective September 19. Restrictions were also put in place on Hungary and Italy. A variety of stakeholders have expressed concern about this plan, with shipping and travel companies saying it should not be their responsibility to ensure that a potential traveller has the correct testing information. Similar to most of the EU, a significant proportion of new cases in Finland have been among young people, with the infection rate among at-risk groups substantially lower than it was in the spring.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Finnish government is considering a rule requiring all travellers present a negative COVID-19 test from their country of origin on arrival and then get tested again once they are in Finland. PM Marin said Finland is looking for ways to allow visitors to enter the country, without easing current restrictions, in order to aid the tourism industry. All remaining restrictions on eateries, including the requirement that every customer have a seat, were extended through the end of September. Confusion surrounding a typo in a press release from the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs resulted in some regions tightening their gathering limits. The Ministry kept the gathering limit at 500 people, but a missing zero saw some regional agencies move their limits to 50. The regional agencies said they understood that the press release was a mistake, but they intended to keep the lower limit due to increasing infection rates across Europe. Nearly one-third of Finland’s population downloaded the government’s contact tracing app in its first week of availability, totaling 1.8 million downloads.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finland reintroduced travel restrictions on Cyprus, Ireland, San Marino, Japan, Iceland, Greece, Malta, Germany, Norway, and Denmark due to a rise in their infection rates. The government clarified that only those presenting symptoms will be subjected to a mandatory quarantine order, while all other arrivals may voluntarily self-isolate. Those who need to cross the border into Norway or Sweden on a daily basis will not be given a quarantine order. Finland will increase its testing capacity from 14,000 to 20,000 a day, after reports of days-long wait times for both the test and results. Helsinki may end its publication of local infection hotspots due their small sample sizes. The local government may release them again in the future if the infection rate worsens in the city.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finland plans to mandate compulsory quarantine for two weeks upon arrival for travellers from high-risk countries. Travellers who violate quarantine rules will face a possible fine or jail time. The government will pay full salaries to low-income earners if they must enter the mandatory quarantine. The Finnish government has asked public health officials to develop a ‘traffic light’ system for travel restrictions. Any changes to the system would be updated weekly, and may take regional situations into account. Finland announced it will recommend the use of face masks on public transit and in other crowded public spaces. It also reintroduced its recommendation to work from home, if possible, due to a rising infection rate in certain areas of the country. Finland reported 41 new cases on August 13, the country’s largest daily increase since May.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare (THL) has tightened its restrictions on Finns returning from travel abroad, forbidding them from going to work and school for two weeks upon return. If violations are suspected, officials from THL would consider implementing a mandatory quarantine order. The updated guidelines came after public health officials reported poor compliance with their recommendations. Public health officials also said that they are likely to introduce a mask-wearing recommendation in the coming weeks, possibly on a regional basis. The Minister of Social Affairs said the government may also reconsider its earlier decision to lift the recommendation to work from home. Finland reinstated travel restrictions on Belgium, the Netherlands, and Andorra due to rising infection rates in the three countries. The school year begins in Finland this week, though some uncertainty remains over the guidelines for reopening issued by the Ministry of Education. Most students will attend classes in-person with enhanced cleaning measures being implemented.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the last major restrictions in Finland were lifted on August 1. Events with more than 500 people will be allowed to take place (with social distancing regulations still enforced). The government will lift its recommendation to work from home. These changes have led some prominent public health officials in the country to call for a mandatory mask policy, which is reportedly under consideration by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). Some municipalities are considering implementing their own restrictions if there are local COVID-19 outbreaks. Restrictions may be imposed on individual towns or neighbourhoods, and would primarily focus on schools, workplaces, and public events. There has been substantial regional variation in contact tracing success, with only about half of those infected in Helsinki being able to track the source of their infection. Finnish officials hope that the release of the country’s contact tracing app later this month will improve their efforts.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finland reinstated travel restrictions on Slovenia, Switzerland, and Austria on July 27 after a rise in COVID-19 cases in those countries. Finland only allows unrestricted travel from countries with fewer than 8 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks. Finland’s contact tracing app will be available for download on August 31. Public health officials have assured Finns that no data will be sent to them without users’ permission, even if they have been exposed to an infectious person. Finns Party MPs have lodged formal complaints with the country’s Chancellor of Justice over PM Marin’s negotiation of the EU recovery package. The MPs said that Marin did not have the approval of Finland’s Constitutional Law Committee to allow Finnish money to be loaned to other EU countries. Marin said that she complied with all protocols, and offered proof of her contact with relevant officials throughout the negotiation process.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">All restrictions on eateries were lifted on July 13, allowing establishments to return to normal operating hours, alcohol serving times and capacity limits. However, social distancing and hygiene regulations must remain in place for the foreseeable future. Upper secondary and vocational school students are expected to resume their studies in-person when the new school year starts in late August. However, they have been told to anticipate rapid changes to restrictions on education in the event of a second wave. More than 200 people may have been exposed to COVID-19 in Rovaniemi after three infected persons were found to have visited a daycare centre, an indoor playground, and a military base.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A number of travel restrictions on both EU and non-EU countries will be lifted on July 13. Unrestricted travel will be allowed from 17 European countries. Work-related and essential travel will be permitted from Algeria, Australia, China, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay. Finland will consider lifting restrictions on the remaining EU countries if their infection rate is below 10 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks. The government continues recommending that all travellers self-isolate upon their arrival in Finland, except for those coming from Nordic or Baltic countries. Going forward, the government will update its travel restrictions every two weeks. The next update will be effective July 27. The closure of schools and daycares had minimal impact on the infection rate among children in Finland, with the Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare (THL) finding similar rates to those in Sweden, where schools were not shut down. As a result, officials from THL said their agency would probably not recommend closing schools in the event of a second wave.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people are now permitted in Finland, though physical distancing requirements remain. Indoor events can have no more than 500 people, with the restriction expected to be lifted on August 1. The country’s top soccer league resumed play on July 1, with rules for fans similar to those in Denmark. A varying number of fans will be let into each stadium, depending on capacity, and will be required to maintain physical distancing. The Minister of the Interior said that, for Finland to even consider lifting border controls on Swedish residents, Sweden’s infection rate would need to drop to the level seen in other Nordic countries. Finland is considering harsh restrictions on regions near the Swedish border due to recent outbreaks connected to cross-border travel. The President of Finland, Sauli Niinistö, said that border controls on Sweden are not aimed at Swedes, but are meant to protect Finland against COVID-19. Niinistö told Swedish reporters that he did not anticipate any long-term impact on relations with Sweden, while some Swedish government officials disagreed.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 13, Finland will no longer require travellers from EU countries with an infection rate of fewer than 8 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks to quarantine themselves on arrival. A dozen EU countries currently meet the criteria to be eligible, but the government will decide on a final list by July 10. The government has also called off its specific recommendations for those over the age of 70, saying that all age groups should practice good hygiene and social distancing but that lockdown measures for the elderly were no longer necessary. Additionally, the government will lift its recommendation to work from home on August 1, though companies should continue to accommodate those who cannot return to the office.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Finnish government ended the country’s state of emergency this week after over three months. The normal legislative process will now resume and the government will stop issuing executive orders. The government will issue amendments to existing laws to Parliament in August that will enable them to react to a potential second wave without resorting to emergency law in the future. Outdoor events of more than 500 people will be permitted to take place, with certain restrictions, on July 1. Organizers will no longer need government approval for indoor or outdoor events of that size starting on August 1. Finland will allow restaurants to operate at 75% capacity and resume normal working hours and alcohol sales on June 22. Minister of Science and Culture Hanna Kosonen said that if the pandemic situation continues to improve, the country will lift all remaining restrictions by October 1.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Finnish government will lift all border restrictions for Nordic and Baltic countries, excluding Sweden, from June 15. The Foreign Ministry continues to advise against unnecessary international travel, and has said that border restrictions to the rest of the Schengen area will remain in place until at least July 14. Additionally, the government announced that large public events of more than 500 people will be permitted to take place starting on July 1, subject to certain restrictions. PM Marin has said that the government is looking to propose amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act to allow them to introduce lockdown measures as fast as possible in the event of a second wave of the virus. Minister of Justice Anna-Maja Henriksson has said that the government is hopeful that many of the remaining restrictions will be lifted in the coming weeks.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">All restrictions on domestic leisure travel were lifted this week as the school year came to an end in Finland. The limits were lifted despite public health officials warning that domestic leisure travel should be strongly discouraged just a few days prior to the announcement. Significant restrictions on eateries, entertainment and gatherings were removed on June 1, with much of Finnish society now reopen. While normal public and private gatherings are now limited to 50 people (previous limit was 10), some mass events of up to 500 people will be permitted if the organizers commit to following social distancing protocols. The government will continue to discuss its coronavirus exit strategy with opposition parties, with the next update expected before June 21. Finland plans to launch its voluntary coronavirus tracing app in August, though the government has said that it will not replace traditional tracing methods conducted by local governments. The government plans to amend its Basic Education Act to allow for more flexibility in moving between in-person schooling and remote learning methods. The amendment would allow for regional variation and temporary changes to learning plans if the pandemic worsens in the next school year.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As some European countries have offered tourists the chance to be tested at the airport upon their arrival to avoid a two week quarantine, Finland has indicated that it will not do the same. Finnish authorities have said that they concur with the European Centre for Disease Control that airport tests can often be ineffective, and the low number of positive cases that will result from this program are not worth the high costs. Public health officials in Finland have continued to advise against domestic leisure travel for the time being, even as most lockdown restrictions will be lifted over the next few weeks. The Constitutional Committee of Finland has said that the country’s restaurant restrictions need to be revised before their scheduled opening on June 1st, with the restrictions being in place for too long and that they should be imposed regionally, not across the board. The government has doubled the number of foreign agricultural workers that will be allowed into the country this summer (from 4500 to 9000) after many large farms stated that they would not be able to complete their harvest in time with such a small number.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Finnish schools reopened this week for all students, though a small number opted to stay home for the rest of the school year. Outbreaks were reported at numerous schools across the country, infecting both students and staff. While the affected classes were sent home for distance learning, the schools remained open after hygiene procedures were initiated. Finland has eased restrictions for those who are over 70 years old, saying that they are able to see their relatives as long as they maintain a distance of two metres and wear a mask. The Finnish government outlined the regulations that will be in place for restaurants and bars after they are allowed to open on June 1st. Each establishment must stop serving alcohol at 10pm, and is limited to half of their normal capacity for the time being. Leaders in the hospitality industry have voiced some pushback to these policies, saying that a capacity that is 75% normal would give restaurant owners more breathing room on their expenses, which are expected to be paid in full.</p>
