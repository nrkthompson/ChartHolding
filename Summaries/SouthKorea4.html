      South Korea is still grappling with a resurgence of COVID-19 where they are seeing new transmissions occurring through various venues. On June 10, QR code-based entry logs were implemented in entertainment facilities and some auditoriums across the country. Private educational institutes, religious facilities, hospitals and other venues are also encouraged to adopt this contact tracing measure.154 Starting June 8, the virus test has been free for all Seoul residents, including those without respiratory symptoms, but with some testing restrictions. Remdesivir has been granted emergency approval for treating critical COVID-19 patients. South Korea’s first clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine will begin this month, and target a total of 160 adults in two stages.155 Although some restrictive measures like gathering bans were reintroduced in the Seoul Metropolitan Region, most businesses and services continue to operate across the country while following infection prevention requirements. Schools have reopened to all students while many students in lower grades are alternating between in-person classes and online teaching.156
