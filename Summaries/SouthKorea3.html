      New Zealand has seen no new cases for 13 days in a row and no single case is still receiving hospital care. Dozens of community-based testing centres are closing around the country and people can be tested by general practitioners. Antibody testing is being conducted among high-risk populations in the Southern Region to reveal cases missed during swab testing. The opposition party is pressuring the government to move to the “Prepare” alert level immediately.Most businesses have reopened with restrictions. Social gatherings can now be held with up to 100 people. Students at all ages have physically returned to school. The Prime Minister revealed the prospect of life under the “Prepare” alert level as everyone having access to businesses and services without restrictions and limits on the maximum number of people attending gatherings. Cabinet will consider moving to the lower alert level on June 8. Still being precautious, the Prime Minister expects their borders to open to Australia by September.
