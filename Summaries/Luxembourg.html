  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Universities and schools in Luxembourg are scheduled to reopen on September 11, with multiple restrictions in place. A hybrid system has been set up but, most students will be attending lectures via video conference. Courses requiring students to attend in person will remain in place, but groups will have to be smaller than 20 people. If a class has more students, a rotation system will be established where each week a different third of the class will be physically present. The other two-thirds will participate from home. Universities will also provide COVID-19 tests for staff and students. Should an individual test positive, the whole class will be put in isolation for 14 days. Childcare centres will be able to operate with groups of up to 30 children. School cafeterias will reopen with similar restrictions as restaurants across the country: no self-service and masks to be worn until seated. A maximum of 10 children would be able to sit at one table. Pupils who prefer not to stay inside the canteen may order a pre-packed lunch. The possibility of closing down an entire school for a limited time will not be ruled out if cases rise exponentially, however, such a measure would only be considered as a last resort.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective August 17, Luxembourgers returning from holidays will be able to request a voucher for a free, voluntary COVID-19 test. The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs confirmed Luxembourg's removal from the German government's list of COVID-19 risk areas--effective August 19.  Germany's Robert Koch Institute classified Luxembourg as a risk zone for the virus on July 14, setting off shockwaves around the Luxembourg-Germany border region. Following collective leave, all construction workers and cleaners returning to work will be tested for COVID-19 effective August 17. Every project involving at least three people will receive vouchers allowing them to test at least 55% of their staff. The distribution of these vouchers will continue until the end of September.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a rise in the number of COVID-19 infections in Luxembourg over the past week, the opposition has demanded that everyone returning from holidays be tested. Luxembourg is likely to extend laws aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19 by restricting public gatherings, fining people who don't comply with distancing measures, and increasing fines for offending businesses. The laws passed at the end of July are expected to be extended beyond their expiration at the end of September. The laws restricted private gatherings to 10 people, allowed fines for people violating isolation and quarantine measures, and permitted the revoking of business licenses for three months from companies that repeatedly failed to enforce distancing rules. Luxembourg City's traditional street market is scheduled to take place on August 31 with a variety of measures in place. Face masks are mandatory for both employees of the shops and visitors. The sale of alcoholic beverages in the public space will be prohibited and food stands will not be permitted in shopping streets. While previous editions of the street market also allowed shops located outside of Luxembourg City to rent spaces, this edition will be limited to shops located in the capital itself.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective August 6, travellers from Luxembourg to Germany are required to carry their test results or get tested on arrival, with the cost of testing paid by the government. As the number of new cases in Luxembourg has risen, manual contact tracing has become more vital than ever before. The infrastructure requires a large number of staff to not only contact those who have tested positive for COVID-19, but also all those who have been in contact with them. Luxembourg's businesses are facing a potential wave of bankruptcies in the autumn as the pandemic weakens the economy and many businesses are forced to close again for weeks this summer.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 31, passengers arriving in the UK from Luxembourg are required to isolate for 14 days.  This follows the removal of Luxembourg from the UK’s quarantine-free list. The decision came after a consistent increase in COVID-19 cases in Luxembourg since the end of June. However, Germany added Luxembourg to its list of countries who fall out of the designated risky zone and won't be required to quarantine on arrival.  This is so as not to slow traffic between the two countries. When travelling to Germany, a negative test no older than two days will be required.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The COVID-19 task force, made up of experts from the research sector, published their projections on July 20.  They highlighted that the Grand Duchy may be experiencing a second wave and it could be worse than the first wave in March and April  unless additional measures are put in place to avert further problems. Effective July 25, a third COVID-19 law came into force in Luxembourg, concerning public and private gatherings, sanctions for businesses, and mask wearing. Indoor and outdoor gatherings of people at home or for private events with more than ten people are prohibited (members of the same household are not included in the total). Gatherings that exceed 10 people are permitted, provided there are assigned seats respecting a minimum distance of two metres. If this is not possible, wearing masks is compulsory. The seat rule does not apply to events and funerals, or to fairs, shows, and markets where the public circulates. The rules for distancing and wearing masks do not apply to children under 6 years old, nor to people who are part of a household or cohabiting. The same applies to religious, cultural and sporting practitioners during their activities.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On 14 July, Germany placed Luxembourg on its list of countries considered “at-risk” due to an increase in the number of cases over the past few weeks. Travellers arriving from Luxembourg are required to quarantine for 14 days and to inform the local health authorities upon arrival. Luxembourg residents working in Germany are currently not allowed to drive to Germany for work-related reasons, but can transit through Germany to reach other countries by bus or train and even layover at German airports. On July 19, the PM and health minister announced a new set of measures tightening social distancing and hygiene rules—including a reduction in the gathering limit, indoors and outdoors, to a maximum of 10. Fines of up to €500 will be imposed on symptomatic people who should be self-quarantining but leave their house. Police are advised to intensify checks on businesses, especially cafés. Businesses can be fined up to €8,000 and closed for 3 months if they break social distancing rules for a second time. Medium- and small-enterprises may also risk losing state aid if they do not comply with the rules.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 11, a growing number of countries have listed Luxembourg as an "at-risk country" following a recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the past weeks. On July 4, Denmark banned travel from Luxembourg. Lithuania also closed its borders to residents from Luxembourg on July 6; Lithuanian residents required to self-isolate upon their return from Luxembourg. While Luxembourg residents can still travel to Estonia and Latvia, they will be required to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. Slovakia also placed restrictions on travellers from Luxembourg:  with 5 days of quarantine and mandatory tests upon arrival. Slovenia and Romania have excluded Luxembourg from their ‘green list’ of countries as of July 7, requiring them to quarantine in Slovenia and self-isolate in Romania upon arrival. Cyprus requires a negative test taken within 72 hours before arrival from tourists from Luxembourg. While Finland reopened its borders to a majority of countries from the Schengen area on July 13, they remain closed to travellers from Luxembourg. Norway also announced on July 10 a 10-day quarantine upon arrival for travellers from Luxembourg. To manage the sudden rise in cases, Luxembourg police have been directed to monitor nightlife and outdoor spaces, such as popular barbecue spots and unauthorised parties in more rural areas. The new infections have mainly been traced back to parties, private gatherings, and bars.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Elementary and secondary schools reopened on June 29 in Luxembourg, with classes resuming in the pre-COVID-19 format. School canteens remain closed. Pupil groups are separated at break time. Schools are following a 8am-1pm timetable. Staff and pupils are organized into groups of 5 for COVID testing, with one person in each group tested each week. However, following the reopening of schools, a number of secondary school pupils have been quarantined after coming into contact with infected individuals at 4 different secondary schools. After a downward trend in the past weeks, COVID-19 cases started increasing a week ago after an infected person passed the virus to fellow party-goers who attended a large social gathering on 12 June. Although parliament voted to lift restrictions on private gatherings this week – such as wearing masks and physical distancing – the health ministry reiterated its advice against people meeting in large groups. Fearing the possibility of a second wave, the government is considering imposing restrictions on gatherings in the coming weeks. On July 3, the UK unveiled a list of quarantine-exempted countries, which included Luxembourg.  Travellers from countries on the list are permitted to enter England without the need to quarantine on arrival, effective July 10.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With an end to the state of emergency announced on June 24, regulations still remain in place, including  mandatory application of masks on public transport, the limitation of guests in bars and restaurants, as well as  penalties for infringements. However, large private gatherings of 20 people or more are allowed without restrictions. The rule is slightly stricter for large public gatherings where people have to be seated and physical distance must be maintained or else face masks are deemed mandatory. Nightclubs and saunas continue to remain closed. The education minister announced the resumption of elementary and secondary schools, effective June 29, with classes to resume with their pre-health crisis format where students will not be split into groups. However, health measures will still apply, with students encouraged to wear masks on school transport and outside of the classroom. Primary schools will be allowed to resume PE classes, although are recommended to conduct these lessons outdoors where possible. A new agreement with Belgium was also announced by the Minister of Finance the following day, under which employees who work in Luxembourg but live in Belgium, will be able to work from home until 31 August without being double-taxed. This initiative is considered to be beneficial for both Luxembourg-based companies and their employees.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, all playgrounds reopened to  children, with no compulsory requirement to wear masks for those under the age of 13. Restaurants can host ten people at one table. Gatherings of people are no longer limited, but groups exceeding twenty people will have to adhere to stricter safety regulations. Outdoor and indoor events with more than twenty people can be organised, as long as there are designated seats for all participants. Safety distances of 2 metres must be assured, or people are obliged to wear masks.  However, effective 16 June, it is no longer a legal requirement to wear a protective mask in a car, but it is compulsory on public transport due to crowding. In an announcement on the following day, RyanAir, announced the resumption of flights from Luxembourg Airport to 10 destinations abroad, effective July. The relaunch of flights, however, remains dependent on travel authorisations by each country. However, flights to Germany are available given that it re-opened all its borders with Luxembourg for all types of travel on June 16.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After the closure of all educational institutes announced in March, the potential use of a video-surveillance platform was announced by universities in Luxembourg, for their upcoming exam session. However, concerns were raised by student associations over fundamental rights and privacy, following which the University of Luxembourg announced on June 5, that they are yet to make a final decision. The university stated that it will assure that the software used, fulfills all criteria when it comes to data protection. However, because this complex process could not be completed at such short notice, this particular instrument is highly unlikely to be used at this moment. Instead, the university will make use of different approaches such as oral exams or tests which students can also take home with them.While the government has declared an end to the state of emergency, effective June 24, all COVID-19 measures are likely to stay in place until further notice. Effective June 10, all outdoor playgrounds reopened without any further restrictions. Children below the age of 13 are no longer required to wear a mask while being in public, but they remain mandatory on school premises. Summer activities for children can be reinstated, but groups should not exceed 50 participants. Gatherings of people below 20 are no longer under any governmental restriction. Nonetheless, wearing masks and keeping distance is still in place. In restaurants, up to 10 people can now sit together at a table, and individual sports and competitions resume with no physical contact.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 29, the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs announced the reopening of  Belgian-Luxembourg border, effective May 30, allowing family visits and grocery shopping from across the border. The first Luxair flights also took off on the following day, to Stockholm, Munich and Hamburg, with passengers required to follow a new set of rules including the compulsory application of face masks during the entire flight and the avoidance of  dumping rubbish in seat pockets. On June 3, the government announced the sustained closure of gyms until June 15, with swimming pools closed indefinitely. All cultural and community centres also remain closed until September 2020, however multi-use sports halls are scheduled to reopen by June 15. The reopening of restaurants and terraces was also announced with revised rules including the closure of bars and restaurants by midnight and the compulsory application of masks while walking around the restaurant, unless seated or facing a fine up to €500.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 25th, 50% of Luxembourg's primary school reopened after being closed for 10 weeks and relying on remote learning, with the other half returning on May 27th. Classes were split into smaller groups with attendance required on a weekly rotational shift. Placement of school desks by 2 metre apart and scheduling of breaks at different times were required by higher levels, whereas restriction of movement and application of masks were deemed unnecessary within classrooms for  kindergarten kids. Cafes and restaurants also reopened on May 27th,  with a maximum of 4 people allowed at a single table outdoors , with indoor dining set to resume by May 29th. Both eateries are ordered to close  by midnight and assure a 1.5 metre distance is present within the groups. In order to provide a boost to the sector, the government also pledged to give every citizen over 16, along with some 200,000 cross border workers from Belgium, France, and Germany, a voucher worth 50 euros to spend in hotels. Civil and religious ceremonies can also resume, under strict conditions such as the application of masks by all attendees along with the maintenance of the 2 metre distance rule. A maximum of 20 people are allowed to attend these events while only 6 are permitted at a home. On May 29th, cinema, theatres, gyms, and sport venues are scheduled to reopen. Swimming pools can only reopen if they provide a valid reopening plan that guarantees the respect of the health and safety measures in place. The  first regular passenger flights  will take place on May 29th,  with Luxair flying to Stockholm, Lisbon, Porto, Hamburg, and Munich.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of May 18th, Germany has opened up its borders with Luxembourg, with no dates announced over the reopening of non-essential travel to UK nationals within the state. On the following day, Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair,  also unveiled more details about its relaunch of activities. The airline announced the resumption of flights to five European cities, effective May 29th. Stockholm, Lisbon, Porto, Hamburg (via Saarbrücken), and Munich are amongst the five states where passengers are allowed  to travel, within the first phase of its relaunch. The airline assures the careful practise of social distancing measures directed by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and WHO, to guarantee the safety of its customers. Restaurants, shops, and hotels are due to begin reopening after May 25th along with the permission of outdoor non-contact sports. The application of masks are deemed mandatory in supermarkets and on public transport throughout all  reopening phases.</p>
