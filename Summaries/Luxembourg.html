  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 11, over 500 new cases and eight more deaths were recorded in Luxembourg. The reproduction rate rose to 1.03. The government announced an extension to the country-wide restrictions for another month. Due to end on December 8, Luxembourg's current restrictions permit a maximum of two people from another household to visit.  The restrictions also include a curfew between 11 pm and 6 am and the closing of restaurants, cafes and bars. Next week, following a vote, the restrictions could be extended until January 15.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 4, the ministry of health recorded 588 new cases of COVID-19. The effective reproduction rate is 0.91. The government stated that it was too early to make a decision on whether the current restrictions will be lifted after December 15. The government is expected to meet next week to discuss the partial lockdown's effects and decide on a process for Christmas. Vaccines will be rolled out in a few months; it will not be obligatory. The vaccines will be free and issued through an invitation system similar to that of the large-scale testing programme. Priority for the vaccine will be given to staff in the healthcare sector, including care home employees. This group will be made up of those working in close proximity to the most vulnerable members of society and will cover roles from doctors to catering staff. The second priority group will be made up of the vulnerable and elderly and will include retirement home residents.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 27, the ministry of health recorded 535 new cases of COVID-19. On November 26, the country entered a partial lockdown until December 15, which includes a curfew between 11 pm to 6 am. Bars and restaurants are closed for dine-in, only take-out and delivery will be available. Hotels remain open and may offer room service. Cinemas, amusement parks, casinos, fairs, theatres, and concert halls have closed down; museums, art centres, libraries, and places of worship remain open. Fitness rooms and swimming pools are also closed to the public, but outdoor sports facilities remain accessible. Group sports with more than four people are prohibited; however, this rule does not apply to school activities, elite athletes, and senior national teams. Indoor gatherings of only two people are permitted. For outdoor gatherings of four to ten people, masks must be worn and distance must be maintained. In the event of non-compliance with the rules, several penalties are being charged.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 19, 519 new COVID-19 cases were reported. The effective reproduction rate is currently 1.00. Luxembourg could be receiving its first batch of vaccines within four weeks, but it remains unclear as to which company's vaccine will be distributed first. Roughly 45,000 doses could be shipped, but as more than one dose is usually required per person, it would only suffice for just over 23,000 people. A commission has been set up to advise on which members of society should receive vaccination priority, and a task force will be developing a national strategy.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 13, 713 new cases have been confirmed by the ministry of health in Luxembourg. The death rate has decreased from 2.12% in the spring to 0.48% now. Luxembourg is eager to avoid a new lockdown, despite being Europe's second-worst hit country in the pandemic. Surrounding countries have imposed much tougher measures -- leading French and Belgian residents to flock to Luxembourg restaurants and hotels, which remain open. The government plans to expand its aid programs for businesses and extend a furlough scheme in which the government takes on the salaries for employees so that they can keep their jobs.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 4, the ministry of health recorded 710 new cases of COVID-19 in the country. Following the rise in cases, the government announced a ban on travellers arriving from Canada, the Republic of Georgia, and Tunisia -- effective November 9. These restrictions will remain in place until December 31. The education ministry announced that pupils and teaching staff will soon be able to benefit from tests administered directly in schools. The ministry is considering imposing a partial remote-learning program for some classes in secondary schools.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 29, 778 new cases of COVID-19 were reported in Luxembourg. From October 30, a curfew will be imposed nationally that will require residents to stay home from 11 pm to 6 am, but exceptions have been granted for people who work or travel home from work during those hours or in other specific cases, such as health emergencies. Additional measures have also been put into place until December 31. Restaurants must close by 11 pm and there is a limit of four people per table, unless guests are from the same household. A maximum of four people are permitted at private home gatherings and for group sports activities. When outdoor gatherings exceed four people, masks are mandatory. At malls and supermarkets, a new "10 square meters per customer" rule has been put in place to limit the density of customers. To ensure strict adherence, the government has decided to increase the minimum fine for infractions related to the COVID law from 25 to 100 euros.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 24. Luxembourg recorded 862 new cases. New restrictions were imposed in the country on October 26, which included restricting the indoor and outdoor gathering limit to 4 people. If a group meeting of more than 4 people does take place, then the application of masks will be mandatory. In addition, a curfew will be introduced from 11:00 pm to 6:00 am and sporting competitions will be put on hold for the upper and national divisions. The measures will be in force for a month. The measures have been authorized as a last attempt to contain the virus while avoiding a second lockdown. The prime minister said the government hopes to avoid another lockdown at all costs.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 16, 1,870 active infections have been recorded in Luxembourg. The effective reproduction rate stands at 1.29. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updated its map of travel restrictions, and included Luxembourg among 17 countries which have been rated red. Despite an increase in the number of cases, which has been blamed on the spread within private households, the prime minister does not plan to implement new restrictions. Voluntary social isolation is encouraged, rather than the imposition of new restrictions on gatherings or movement, a decision vastly contrasting other EU countries.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The average daily number of new infections is 88 per 100,000 residents as of October 11, far more than neighboring countries. On October 9, the government clarified the conditions of working from home, when a period of isolation or quarantine has been applied by the employee. The ministries of labour, health, and social security have indicated that employees must obtain written proof from their employer. The employee must be authorized to work remotely, even if they are subject to a period of isolation or quarantine (i.e. if they are a contact case or contaminated by the virus). Most importantly, working remotely cannot be in conflict with the isolation order issued by the health department.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective October 3, residents will be allowed to enter Saaarland and the Rhineland-Palatinate for 24 hours at a time, without providing a negative COVID-19 test. This rule will apply to everyone, not only cross-border employees. On October 5, The Horesca federation requested to allow bars and restaurants to stay open past midnight because, as outside temperatures are falling and fewer patrons can be seated outside, establishments could dedicate more attention to properly organizing distance rules inside their facilities thereby also discouraging private parties where people break social distancing rules. The federation has also emphasized that establishments would continue to uphold all safety regulations.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective September 25, people arriving into Belgium from Luxembourg must undergo a mandatory screening and quarantine. Travel from Belgium to Luxembourg has also been restricted, with non-essential journeys to the Grand Duchy being "strongly" discouraged. For stays exceeding 48 hours, an identification form has to be filled out. Following this move, Germany also added Luxembourg back to its 'red list.' Luxembourg residents are only allowed to cross the border with a negative COVID-19 test which must not be more than 48 hours old. On September 28, Luxembourg will be added to Switzerland's list of high-risk countries. On September 24, the Minister of Health provided updates on their large-scale testing scheme, which ended its first phase recently. Phase 1 lasted until the end of summer to allow for workers in the construction sector, schools, and holidaymakers to return home and resume normal life. Phase 2 of the testing scheme will focus on 5 key areas including individuals with a high risk of exposure to the virus, such as those working in the healthcare sector. Travellers entering the country will also continue to receive test vouchers. Another aspect of the scheme will maintain the sampling tests across the population, focusing on reactive tests in instances where patterns are identified.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Luxembourgís education ministry has formulated a plan to make school during COVID-19 as normal as possible. Three scenarios have been established if infections arise among the students. Should an individual infection occur, the class will undergo distancing from the rest of the school community but will not have to go into quarantine. A quarantine will only be implemented if there are multiple infections within one class. If a chain of infections is identified, new measures will be taken. The class that undergoes distancing due to an individual infection will have to adhere to further measures. The students will no longer be allowed to attend after-school child care or participate in extracurricular activities. As soon as the child has been officially traced and given a statement by the Ministry of Health, one parent may work part-time (this family leave will not be deducted from the normal allowance). In terms of tracing, the process should not last longer than a day. The Ministry of Social Security clarified that parents will normally be notified about their family leave the day after a classmate has been tested positive. However, parents that stay at home because the child is at-risk and has to take online classes will no longer have the right to additional family leave. The process thus has returned to pre-lockdown measures -- only those affected by an infection have the right to family leave, as do those who have been ordered to self-isolate.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Universities and schools in Luxembourg are scheduled to reopen on September 11, with multiple restrictions in place. A hybrid system has been set up but, most students will be attending lectures via video conference. Courses requiring students to attend in person will remain in place, but groups will have to be smaller than 20 people. If a class has more students, a rotation system will be established where each week a different third of the class will be physically present. The other two-thirds will participate from home. Universities will also provide COVID-19 tests for staff and students. Should an individual test positive, the whole class will be put in isolation for 14 days. Childcare centres will be able to operate with groups of up to 30 children. School cafeterias will reopen with similar restrictions as restaurants across the country: no self-service and masks to be worn until seated. A maximum of 10 children would be able to sit at one table. Pupils who prefer not to stay inside the canteen may order a pre-packed lunch. The possibility of closing down an entire school for a limited time will not be ruled out if cases rise exponentially, however, such a measure would only be considered as a last resort.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective August 17, Luxembourgers returning from holidays will be able to request a voucher for a free, voluntary COVID-19 test. The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs confirmed Luxembourg's removal from the German government's list of COVID-19 risk areas--effective August 19.  Germany's Robert Koch Institute classified Luxembourg as a risk zone for the virus on July 14, setting off shockwaves around the Luxembourg-Germany border region. Following collective leave, all construction workers and cleaners returning to work will be tested for COVID-19 effective August 17. Every project involving at least three people will receive vouchers allowing them to test at least 55% of their staff. The distribution of these vouchers will continue until the end of September.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a rise in the number of COVID-19 infections in Luxembourg over the past week, the opposition has demanded that everyone returning from holidays be tested. Luxembourg is likely to extend laws aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19 by restricting public gatherings, fining people who don't comply with distancing measures, and increasing fines for offending businesses. The laws passed at the end of July are expected to be extended beyond their expiration at the end of September. The laws restricted private gatherings to 10 people, allowed fines for people violating isolation and quarantine measures, and permitted the revoking of business licenses for three months from companies that repeatedly failed to enforce distancing rules. Luxembourg City's traditional street market is scheduled to take place on August 31 with a variety of measures in place. Face masks are mandatory for both employees of the shops and visitors. The sale of alcoholic beverages in the public space will be prohibited and food stands will not be permitted in shopping streets. While previous editions of the street market also allowed shops located outside of Luxembourg City to rent spaces, this edition will be limited to shops located in the capital itself.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective August 6, travellers from Luxembourg to Germany are required to carry their test results or get tested on arrival, with the cost of testing paid by the government. As the number of new cases in Luxembourg has risen, manual contact tracing has become more vital than ever before. The infrastructure requires a large number of staff to not only contact those who have tested positive for COVID-19, but also all those who have been in contact with them. Luxembourg's businesses are facing a potential wave of bankruptcies in the autumn as the pandemic weakens the economy and many businesses are forced to close again for weeks this summer.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 31, passengers arriving in the UK from Luxembourg are required to isolate for 14 days.  This follows the removal of Luxembourg from the UKís quarantine-free list. The decision came after a consistent increase in COVID-19 cases in Luxembourg since the end of June. However, Germany added Luxembourg to its list of countries who fall out of the designated risky zone and won't be required to quarantine on arrival.  This is so as not to slow traffic between the two countries. When travelling to Germany, a negative test no older than two days will be required.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The COVID-19 task force, made up of experts from the research sector, published their projections on July 20.  They highlighted that the Grand Duchy may be experiencing a second wave and it could be worse than the first wave in March and April  unless additional measures are put in place to avert further problems. Effective July 25, a third COVID-19 law came into force in Luxembourg, concerning public and private gatherings, sanctions for businesses, and mask wearing. Indoor and outdoor gatherings of people at home or for private events with more than ten people are prohibited (members of the same household are not included in the total). Gatherings that exceed 10 people are permitted, provided there are assigned seats respecting a minimum distance of two metres. If this is not possible, wearing masks is compulsory. The seat rule does not apply to events and funerals, or to fairs, shows, and markets where the public circulates. The rules for distancing and wearing masks do not apply to children under 6 years old, nor to people who are part of a household or cohabiting. The same applies to religious, cultural and sporting practitioners during their activities.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On 14 July, Germany placed Luxembourg on its list of countries considered ìat-riskî due to an increase in the number of cases over the past few weeks. Travellers arriving from Luxembourg are required to quarantine for 14 days and to inform the local health authorities upon arrival. Luxembourg residents working in Germany are currently not allowed to drive to Germany for work-related reasons, but can transit through Germany to reach other countries by bus or train and even layover at German airports. On July 19, the PM and health minister announced a new set of measures tightening social distancing and hygiene rulesóincluding a reduction in the gathering limit, indoors and outdoors, to a maximum of 10. Fines of up to Ä500 will be imposed on symptomatic people who should be self-quarantining but leave their house. Police are advised to intensify checks on businesses, especially cafÈs. Businesses can be fined up to Ä8,000 and closed for 3 months if they break social distancing rules for a second time. Medium- and small-enterprises may also risk losing state aid if they do not comply with the rules.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 11, a growing number of countries have listed Luxembourg as an "at-risk country" following a recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the past weeks. On July 4, Denmark banned travel from Luxembourg. Lithuania also closed its borders to residents from Luxembourg on July 6; Lithuanian residents required to self-isolate upon their return from Luxembourg. While Luxembourg residents can still travel to Estonia and Latvia, they will be required to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. Slovakia also placed restrictions on travellers from Luxembourg:  with 5 days of quarantine and mandatory tests upon arrival. Slovenia and Romania have excluded Luxembourg from their ëgreen listí of countries as of July 7, requiring them to quarantine in Slovenia and self-isolate in Romania upon arrival. Cyprus requires a negative test taken within 72 hours before arrival from tourists from Luxembourg. While Finland reopened its borders to a majority of countries from the Schengen area on July 13, they remain closed to travellers from Luxembourg. Norway also announced on July 10 a 10-day quarantine upon arrival for travellers from Luxembourg. To manage the sudden rise in cases, Luxembourg police have been directed to monitor nightlife and outdoor spaces, such as popular barbecue spots and unauthorised parties in more rural areas. The new infections have mainly been traced back to parties, private gatherings, and bars.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Elementary and secondary schools reopened on June 29 in Luxembourg, with classes resuming in the pre-COVID-19 format. School canteens remain closed. Pupil groups are separated at break time. Schools are following a 8am-1pm timetable. Staff and pupils are organized into groups of 5 for COVID testing, with one person in each group tested each week. However, following the reopening of schools, a number of secondary school pupils have been quarantined after coming into contact with infected individuals at 4 different secondary schools. After a downward trend in the past weeks, COVID-19 cases started increasing a week ago after an infected person passed the virus to fellow party-goers who attended a large social gathering on 12 June. Although parliament voted to lift restrictions on private gatherings this week ñ such as wearing masks and physical distancing ñ the health ministry reiterated its advice against people meeting in large groups. Fearing the possibility of a second wave, the government is considering imposing restrictions on gatherings in the coming weeks. On July 3, the UK unveiled a list of quarantine-exempted countries, which included Luxembourg.  Travellers from countries on the list are permitted to enter England without the need to quarantine on arrival, effective July 10.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With an end to the state of emergency announced on June 24, regulations still remain in place, including  mandatory application of masks on public transport, the limitation of guests in bars and restaurants, as well as  penalties for infringements. However, large private gatherings of 20 people or more are allowed without restrictions. The rule is slightly stricter for large public gatherings where people have to be seated and physical distance must be maintained or else face masks are deemed mandatory. Nightclubs and saunas continue to remain closed. The education minister announced the resumption of elementary and secondary schools, effective June 29, with classes to resume with their pre-health crisis format where students will not be split into groups. However, health measures will still apply, with students encouraged to wear masks on school transport and outside of the classroom. Primary schools will be allowed to resume PE classes, although are recommended to conduct these lessons outdoors where possible. A new agreement with Belgium was also announced by the Minister of Finance the following day, under which employees who work in Luxembourg but live in Belgium, will be able to work from home until 31 August without being double-taxed. This initiative is considered to be beneficial for both Luxembourg-based companies and their employees.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, all playgrounds reopened to  children, with no compulsory requirement to wear masks for those under the age of 13. Restaurants can host ten people at one table. Gatherings of people are no longer limited, but groups exceeding twenty people will have to adhere to stricter safety regulations. Outdoor and indoor events with more than twenty people can be organised, as long as there are designated seats for all participants. Safety distances of 2 metres must be assured, or people are obliged to wear masks.  However, effective 16 June, it is no longer a legal requirement to wear a protective mask in a car, but it is compulsory on public transport due to crowding. In an announcement on the following day, RyanAir, announced the resumption of flights from Luxembourg Airport to 10 destinations abroad, effective July. The relaunch of flights, however, remains dependent on travel authorisations by each country. However, flights to Germany are available given that it re-opened all its borders with Luxembourg for all types of travel on June 16.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">After the closure of all educational institutes announced in March, the potential use of a video-surveillance platform was announced by universities in Luxembourg, for their upcoming exam session. However, concerns were raised by student associations over fundamental rights and privacy, following which the University of Luxembourg announced on June 5, that they are yet to make a final decision. The university stated that it will assure that the software used, fulfills all criteria when it comes to data protection. However, because this complex process could not be completed at such short notice, this particular instrument is highly unlikely to be used at this moment. Instead, the university will make use of different approaches such as oral exams or tests which students can also take home with them.While the government has declared an end to the state of emergency, effective June 24, all COVID-19 measures are likely to stay in place until further notice. Effective June 10, all outdoor playgrounds reopened without any further restrictions. Children below the age of 13 are no longer required to wear a mask while being in public, but they remain mandatory on school premises. Summer activities for children can be reinstated, but groups should not exceed 50 participants. Gatherings of people below 20 are no longer under any governmental restriction. Nonetheless, wearing masks and keeping distance is still in place. In restaurants, up to 10 people can now sit together at a table, and individual sports and competitions resume with no physical contact.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 29, the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs announced the reopening of  Belgian-Luxembourg border, effective May 30, allowing family visits and grocery shopping from across the border. The first Luxair flights also took off on the following day, to Stockholm, Munich and Hamburg, with passengers required to follow a new set of rules including the compulsory application of face masks during the entire flight and the avoidance of  dumping rubbish in seat pockets. On June 3, the government announced the sustained closure of gyms until June 15, with swimming pools closed indefinitely. All cultural and community centres also remain closed until September 2020, however multi-use sports halls are scheduled to reopen by June 15. The reopening of restaurants and terraces was also announced with revised rules including the closure of bars and restaurants by midnight and the compulsory application of masks while walking around the restaurant, unless seated or facing a fine up to Ä500.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On May 25th, 50% of Luxembourg's primary school reopened after being closed for 10 weeks and relying on remote learning, with the other half returning on May 27th. Classes were split into smaller groups with attendance required on a weekly rotational shift. Placement of school desks by 2 metre apart and scheduling of breaks at different times were required by higher levels, whereas restriction of movement and application of masks were deemed unnecessary within classrooms for  kindergarten kids. Cafes and restaurants also reopened on May 27th,  with a maximum of 4 people allowed at a single table outdoors , with indoor dining set to resume by May 29th. Both eateries are ordered to close  by midnight and assure a 1.5 metre distance is present within the groups. In order to provide a boost to the sector, the government also pledged to give every citizen over 16, along with some 200,000 cross border workers from Belgium, France, and Germany, a voucher worth 50 euros to spend in hotels. Civil and religious ceremonies can also resume, under strict conditions such as the application of masks by all attendees along with the maintenance of the 2 metre distance rule. A maximum of 20 people are allowed to attend these events while only 6 are permitted at a home. On May 29th, cinema, theatres, gyms, and sport venues are scheduled to reopen. Swimming pools can only reopen if they provide a valid reopening plan that guarantees the respect of the health and safety measures in place. The  first regular passenger flights  will take place on May 29th,  with Luxair flying to Stockholm, Lisbon, Porto, Hamburg, and Munich.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of May 18th, Germany has opened up its borders with Luxembourg, with no dates announced over the reopening of non-essential travel to UK nationals within the state. On the following day, Luxembourg's flag carrier, Luxair,  also unveiled more details about its relaunch of activities. The airline announced the resumption of flights to five European cities, effective May 29th. Stockholm, Lisbon, Porto, Hamburg (via Saarbr¸cken), and Munich are amongst the five states where passengers are allowed  to travel, within the first phase of its relaunch. The airline assures the careful practise of social distancing measures directed by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and WHO, to guarantee the safety of its customers. Restaurants, shops, and hotels are due to begin reopening after May 25th along with the permission of outdoor non-contact sports. The application of masks are deemed mandatory in supermarkets and on public transport throughout all  reopening phases.</p>
