      With no active cases within its borders, New Zealand moved to a “Prepare” alert level on midnight June 8. There have been no new cases for more than 2 weeks. Intensive testing will continue. Border controls will be enhanced to better handle imported cases. Beginning the week of June 8, anyone entering New Zealand has to be tested twice during their mandatory two-week quarantine. With physical distancing and mass gathering restrictions completely lifted, people can now return to their normal life despite the need to stay vigilant and practice good hygiene. Schools and workplaces are fully opened. Businesses and individuals are still recommended to keep track of those they come in contact with. Domestic transport can operate at full capacity with no restrictions. New Zealand borders remain closed to all foreign travellers, however, with the film industry returning to work, special permissions are granted to a limited number of foreign crew members.
