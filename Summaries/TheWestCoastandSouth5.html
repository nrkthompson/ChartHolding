      The number of COVID-19 cases is increasing in the South and West. On June 11, the Governor of Washington released a plan to reopen schools fall 2020-2021. In fall, 15-20% of UCLA classes will be either in-person or hybrid. Dr. Fauci explained that an uptick in cases as states open is less concerning than the increase in hospitalizations, which approximately six states are experiencing with reopening. On Friday June 12, Texas and North Carolina reported the highest hospitalization numbers. The governor of Texas explained that Texas would continue reopening since despite their hospitalization numbers, hospital beds remain available. California will allow food trucks with sanitary restrictions. The Director of Health in Orange County, California, resigned after protests at her home and death threats against her for making the use of masks mandatory in May. Case numbers are rising in Florida, and some models predict that it could be a new large epicenter of the virus in the US.
