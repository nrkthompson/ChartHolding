      The Lithuanian government has continued easing lockdown restrictions after receiving praise from the international community for its domestic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All primary schools and post-secondary institutions have been allowed to reopen and hold in-person classes since May 25, while secondary schools were allowed to reopen on May 30. Indoor and outdoor high-performance athletic competitions have been allowed to take place without the presence of spectators since May 30, while private celebrations have been allowed to take place in public venues with up to 30 guests. Most international flights to and from Lithuania remain grounded, with the exception of flights between Vilnius, Frankfurt (Germany), and Riga (Latvia), which have been allowed since May 13 and May 18 respectively, and regular flights between Vilnius, Oslo (Norway), and Tallinn (Estonia), which were allowed to resume on May 25. On June 1, the Lithuanian government approved a list of 24 European countries whose citizens will be allowed to enter Lithuania without a mandatory self-isolation period upon arrival, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, and Poland. Travel is still prohibited to and from Belgium, Sweden, Portugal, and the UK.
