  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">From August 26 to September 8, the Polish government is expected to resume air travel between a number of countries, including Russia, China, Singapore, Gabon, and Serbia. At the same time, Poland’s “black list” of countries from which air travel to Poland is banned has been expanded from 44 to 63 countries. It now includes Albania, Belgium, Venezuela, India, Spain, Lebanon, Romania, and the US.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 12, travellers from more than 40 countries have been banned from flying to Poland for at least two week--including China, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and the United States. The list was produced on the basis of analyses of the epidemiological status of each given country, taking into particular consideration the 14-day moving average of the number of COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Poland reported record highs with respect to daily COVID-19 infections for 3 days in a row between August 6 and 8: 726, 809, and 843 cases were confirmed on each day, respectively. On August 8, the Polish government implemented a new regional alert system, classifying each of its counties as either red, yellow, or green--based on their relative level of epidemiological stability. Based on the assigned level, each county may have varying levels and types of restrictions, such as mandatory mask wearing and limits on the organization of public and private events such as weddings, concerts, and fairs. Nine of Poland’s counties – mainly in the country’s southern region near the Slovak border – are currently classified as “red” and a further 10 have been classified as yellow. The rest of Poland’s 380 powiats are classified as “green.”</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 4, Poland reported another record daily increase in COVID-19 infections, with at least 680 confirmed cases and 6 deaths.  This follows a spike driven by outbreaks among coal miners and at large public gatherings. The new daily record comes a week after Polish authorities decided to ease certain restrictions related to COVID-19, particularly those limiting the number of participants in public gatherings, sporting events, and artistic performances.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 25, it is mandatory for anyone residing in Poland to maintain at least 1.5 metres of distance between themselves and other pedestrians in public places, unless they are wearing a mask. Physical distancing is recommended for pedestrians with masks, but not mandatory. Public sporting events are allowed to take place with up to 250 participants in the crowd effective July 25. International flights to and from Poland are set to resume on July 28. Air traffic was previously limited to domestic carriers.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Starting on July 17, assemblies, parties, events, and other gatherings will be allowed to take place in open spaces without a strict limit on the number of participants—provided that an acceptable distance can be maintained between each individual.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 12, incumbent President Andrzej Duda narrowly defeated Rafa? Trzaskowski, mayor of Warsaw, in the second round of Poland’s presidential election.
