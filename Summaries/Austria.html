  <p>
      Effective July 1, up to 250 people can gather indoors and 500 person events will be permitted outdoors with assigned and labelled seating. Currently, visitors from outside the EU or Schengen zone area are prohibited from entering Austria. More than 1,500 workers at an abattoir in the western German state of Rhine-Westphalia have tested positive for COVID-19, prompting the Austrian government to ban non-essential travel to Rhine-Westphalia. All direct flights between Austria and the state are restricted while the towns are under lockdown. Austria relies on tourists from Germany and quickly lifted restrictions at the country's shared borders.A study in the Alpine ski resort of Ischgl, the site of Austria’s largest outbreak, found 42% of residents have COVID-19 antibodies, the highest rate ever proven globally.

  <p>
      Effective June 15, masks are no longer mandatory in shops, schools and tourist areas. Face coverings remain mandatory on public transit, in health facilities and for contact services where social distancing is difficult to maintain. While Austrian borders have been open to neighbouring countries since June 4, as of June 16 this extended to all EU countries, except the UK, Sweden, Spain and Portugal. Despite reopening the Austria-Germany border, federal police will continue to control the border for immigration and criminal activity. Exhibitions, conventions, trade fairs and large meetings can resume across the country, allowing the event industry to resume operations.

  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p>
      Effective June 15, masks will no longer be mandatory in shops, schools and tourist areas. However, covering the mouth and nose will remain mandatory on public transit, in health facilities, including in pharmacies and in other service institutions where social distancing is hard to maintain, such as with hairdressers, beauty salons and in restaurants. Last week, Austria lifted border restrictions with all of its neighbouring countries with the exception of Italy. The Austrian government has since announced that on June 16, it will reopen its borders to more than 24 countries, including Italy. The decision should ease tensions after Austria singled out Italy for its continued high number of infections and deaths. All EU, EFTA (European Free Trade Association), and EEA (European Economic Area) states will be allowed to enter with the exception of Sweden, Great Britain, Spain and Portugal. Travellers entering Austria from other European countries will not be subject to quarantine nor required to show proof of a negative test.

  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p>
      The Austrian government announced a new phase of fewer restrictions and more individual responsibility for its citizens, following fewer than 50 new infections in the last few weeks. Gyms, swimming pools, camping sites, hotels, zoos, and cinemas reopened under strict social distancing and hygiene measures. Effective June 15, nose and mouth coverings will no longer be mandatory in shops, schools, and tourist areas. However, facial coverings will remain mandatory on public transit, in health facilities, including pharmacies  and in service institutions where social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as hairdressers, and restaurants.  In restaurants,  restrictions on the number of people per table will end along with the extension of opening hours from 11 pm to 1 am. Related to border controls, on June 4 quarantines will no longer be required when entering Austria from its 7 neighbouring countries, excluding Italy. The Foreign Minister is advising citizens to refrain from unnecessary travel and to holiday within Austria despite reopening. The Health Ministry approved safety conditions for Austria to host two Formula One Grand Prix races on July 5th and 12th without spectators and with limited numbers of people involved.

  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p>
      Effective May 29, leisure attractions such as zoos and swimming pools will be allowed to reopen in Austria. Despite several airports being operational, limited services are available and international travel is limited until May 31. In an effort to encourage tourists to visit Austria this summer, the government has planned to expand testing to screen hotel staff, with hotels set to reopen on May 29. As of July 1, private labs will be utilized to test 65,000 hotel workers weekly. Effective May 26, the Czech Republic opened its borders with Austria, putting an end to border checks for residents. Cross-border travel will be permitted with other countries - such as Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Hungary - by June 15. Travellers must carry evidence of a negative test, and those without one must self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. All major events remain prohibited, and people cannot gather in groups larger than 10. Austria’s President, Alexander Van der Bellen, has apologized after breaching the government’s COVID-10 imposed curfew of 11pm, which has enabled restaurants and cafes to reopen.
  </p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p>
      Effective May 15, restaurants, bars, churches, and some museums have been allowed to reopen. The Austrian government has lifted some travel restrictions with Germany and Switzerland, resulting in the continuation of all travel between these countries, and the full reopening of borders by June 15. At the moment, residents of these countries are being allowed to cross the Austrian border after completing a self-declaration form. On May 18, elementary schools, lower grades in high schools, and special needs schools were reopened, while all other students will return to school on June 3. Students returning to school will operate under a shift system, with only half the class being present at all times to maintain social distancing measures. Large gatherings remain banned until at least August 31, and the Austrian government is still working on plans for theatres to resume while respecting social distancing rules. The Junior Minister for Culture stepped down after increasing pressure from theatre directors and performers over the lack of urgency in reopening cultural venues, even as the lockdown in Austria is eased. The resignation is critical to the left-wing Green party, who has been under fire for their limited role as a counterweight to their coalition partner,  Chancellor Kurz’s conservative party.
