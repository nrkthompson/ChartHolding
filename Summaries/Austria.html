  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Austria, rising daily cases of COVID-19 are prompting the chancellor to reimpose restrictions. Travel warnings have been issued for Prague and several French regions, while restriction on travel to Sweden have been lifted. New measures were announced for the upcoming ski-season in the tourist states of Tirol, Vorarlberg, and Salzburg. Alongside a 10 pm curfew, visitors will not be able to attend post-skiing parties. However, skiing, dining, and cultural events will still be available. Mandatory face covering rules will likely be in place on ski-lifts alongside physical distancing measures during the boarding process. At restaurants and bars, people must be seated while eating and drinking in efforts to reduce crowding.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chancellor Kurz reinforced the need for Austrians to follow COVID-19 measures as the country begins to experience a second wave of infections. The chancellor suggested that employees work from home where possible. More than half of the new cases are in the capital, Vienna. In response, the government is restricting events and reinstating mandatory mask regulations. Private indoor gatherings have been limited to a maximum of 10 people. Masks remain mandatory on public transit but, effective September 14, are now mandatory in all public areas -- including supermarkets, retail shops, and schools.  In restaurants and bars, only seated customers can be served -- with a maximum of 10 people per table. The Austrian government does not expect the situation to improve and plans to keep these measures in place throughout the winter.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Austria, Chancellor Kurz intends to keep ski resorts operating and schools open throughout the winter. AprËs ski partying will not be permitted at many ski resorts after a popular resort in Ischgl became a hotspot in early March. Measures at ski resorts will include offering workers and guests tests, making face masks mandatory in cable cars and lifts, and monitoring wastewater to assess the presence of the virus.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Austria, the government is expanding its travel warning for Spain to include the Balearic Islands, which include Mallorca and Ibiza. The travel warning came into effect on August 24, with travellers required to present a negative test or quarantine on arrival.The Austrian government rejected the Croatian governmentís request that new travel restrictions only be imposed on certain areas of Croatia. The UK has removed Austria from its travel corridor list, subjecting arrivals to quarantine for two weeks.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Austria continues to experience a slight increase in daily new infections. Face masks remain mandatory in all public and indoor spaces. Sweden is no longer advising its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Austria. However, Austria is warning against travel to Croatia after 57 new cases were found in travellers returning from the country. Effective August 17, people returning to Austria from Croatia will be required to present a negative COVID-19 test from within the last 72 hours.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Viennaís International Airport announced new entry regulations for citizens arriving in Austria from high risk countries. The decision came into effect on August 1, after the country lifted its travel ban on flights from 18 countries. The new entry regulations will include arrivals taking a mandatory COVID-19 test. The government announced an extension to the work scheme introduced in March to prevent layoffs until March 2021. The scheme aims to help counter shortages in the care sector and support retraining to help businesses find qualified staff.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Austrian government has imposed travel restrictions on 32 countries--including Mexico, the US, Chile, and Sweden--in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Medical professionals, seasonal workers, and diplomats are exempted from this decision but will be required to take a test. In effect until September 30, 2020, Austria continues to allow entry for travellers from 30 EU countries without testing and quarantine measures. On July 28, an outbreak was traced to hotels, bars, and guesthouses at an Austrian holiday resort in Upper Austria.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since July 24, everyone in Austria has been required to wear face masks in supermarkets, grocery stores, post offices, and banks due to a rise in infections. Mandatory face mask use was already in place on public transportation and in pharmacies. Restrictions are being reintroduced for religious services and churches after several outbreaks were connected to them. Many Serbian Orthodox churches have been closed and will reopen on August 1. In response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the Western Balkans, the Austrian government imposed a direct flight ban for all countries in the region until the end of July. Police checks at the border will focus on vehicle plates from countries with rising infection rates.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Austriaís Health Ministry extended until July 31 a flight ban that affects arrivals from several countries. The ban includes Albania, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, Portugal, Serbia, Sweden, and the UK. There are exceptions for flights bringing in cargo, repatriated Austrians, medical caregivers, and agricultural workers. On July 16, flights from the Lombardy region in Italy will be permitted. Travellers from a list of 30 EU countries can now enter Austria without having to comply with health measures if they can prove they have not been in a country other than Austria or one on the list in the past 14 days. This list includes Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, and Switzerland. Travellers from countries not on this list must show proof of a negative test or quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in Austria. At this time, international travellers from outside the EU and Schengen Area are not permitted.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Austria, new outbreaks of COVID-19 connected to foreign travel have emerged--with the majority linked to the Balkan region. The travel warnings issued last week for Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Albania, and Kosovo remain in effect. On July 8, the Austrian government issued travel warnings for Bulgaria, Romania, and Moldova due to their epidemiological situation. Austrians arriving from these countries must enter a 14-day quarantine or show proof of a negative COVID-19 test. The Austrian government will be increasing checks at the Hungarian and Slovenian borders. More than 3,000 people in the state of Upper Austria, which borders Germany and the Czech Republic, have been placed under quarantine to contain an outbreak.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Austrian government has loosened several restrictions related to restaurants and physical distancing. Waiters are no longer required to wear face masks in restaurants and people no longer have to stay a metre apart while playing a sport. Austria has allowed brothels to resume service as of July 1. Austria has issued its highest level of travel warning for the western Balkans (Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo) after a spike in cases. The warning will affect all travel to the region and the government recommends Austrians return from these countries immediately. Citizens returning from the region are subject to a 14-day quarantine or must show proof of a negative COVID-19 test. The UK, Portugal, Sweden, and Turkey are also subject to the highest warning level. After COVID-19 forced the postponement of the Formula One racing schedule, two races resumed in Austria on July 5. The races are being run under strict health and safety conditions and teams will be operating in bubbles and isolating from one another. Face masks and PPE are required for teams and no spectators will be present at the races.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 1, up to 250 people can gather indoors and 500 person events will be permitted outdoors with assigned and labelled seating. Currently, visitors from outside the EU or Schengen zone area are prohibited from entering Austria. More than 1,500 workers at an abattoir in the western German state of Rhine-Westphalia have tested positive for COVID-19, prompting the Austrian government to ban non-essential travel to Rhine-Westphalia. All direct flights between Austria and the state are restricted while the towns are under lockdown. Austria relies on tourists from Germany and quickly lifted restrictions at the country's shared borders.A study in the Alpine ski resort of Ischgl, the site of Austriaís largest outbreak, found 42% of residents have COVID-19 antibodies, the highest rate ever proven globally.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective June 15, masks are no longer mandatory in shops, schools and tourist areas. Face coverings remain mandatory on public transit, in health facilities and for contact services where social distancing is difficult to maintain. While Austrian borders have been open to neighbouring countries since June 4, as of June 16 this extended to all EU countries, except the UK, Sweden, Spain and Portugal. Despite reopening the Austria-Germany border, federal police will continue to control the border for immigration and criminal activity. Exhibitions, conventions, trade fairs and large meetings can resume across the country, allowing the event industry to resume operations.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective June 15, masks will no longer be mandatory in shops, schools and tourist areas. However, covering the mouth and nose will remain mandatory on public transit, in health facilities, including in pharmacies and in other service institutions where social distancing is hard to maintain, such as with hairdressers, beauty salons and in restaurants. Last week, Austria lifted border restrictions with all of its neighbouring countries with the exception of Italy. The Austrian government has since announced that on June 16, it will reopen its borders to more than 24 countries, including Italy. The decision should ease tensions after Austria singled out Italy for its continued high number of infections and deaths. All EU, EFTA (European Free Trade Association), and EEA (European Economic Area) states will be allowed to enter with the exception of Sweden, Great Britain, Spain and Portugal. Travellers entering Austria from other European countries will not be subject to quarantine nor required to show proof of a negative test.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Austrian government announced a new phase of fewer restrictions and more individual responsibility for its citizens, following fewer than 50 new infections in the last few weeks. Gyms, swimming pools, camping sites, hotels, zoos, and cinemas reopened under strict social distancing and hygiene measures. Effective June 15, nose and mouth coverings will no longer be mandatory in shops, schools, and tourist areas. However, facial coverings will remain mandatory on public transit, in health facilities, including pharmacies  and in service institutions where social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as hairdressers, and restaurants.  In restaurants,  restrictions on the number of people per table will end along with the extension of opening hours from 11 pm to 1 am. Related to border controls, on June 4 quarantines will no longer be required when entering Austria from its 7 neighbouring countries, excluding Italy. The Foreign Minister is advising citizens to refrain from unnecessary travel and to holiday within Austria despite reopening. The Health Ministry approved safety conditions for Austria to host two Formula One Grand Prix races on July 5th and 12th without spectators and with limited numbers of people involved.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective May 29, leisure attractions such as zoos and swimming pools will be allowed to reopen in Austria. Despite several airports being operational, limited services are available and international travel is limited until May 31. In an effort to encourage tourists to visit Austria this summer, the government has planned to expand testing to screen hotel staff, with hotels set to reopen on May 29. As of July 1, private labs will be utilized to test 65,000 hotel workers weekly. Effective May 26, the Czech Republic opened its borders with Austria, putting an end to border checks for residents. Cross-border travel will be permitted with other countries - such as Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Hungary - by June 15. Travellers must carry evidence of a negative test, and those without one must self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. All major events remain prohibited, and people cannot gather in groups larger than 10. Austriaís President, Alexander Van der Bellen, has apologized after breaching the governmentís COVID-10 imposed curfew of 11pm, which has enabled restaurants and cafes to reopen.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective May 15, restaurants, bars, churches, and some museums have been allowed to reopen. The Austrian government has lifted some travel restrictions with Germany and Switzerland, resulting in the continuation of all travel between these countries, and the full reopening of borders by June 15. At the moment, residents of these countries are being allowed to cross the Austrian border after completing a self-declaration form. On May 18, elementary schools, lower grades in high schools, and special needs schools were reopened, while all other students will return to school on June 3. Students returning to school will operate under a shift system, with only half the class being present at all times to maintain social distancing measures. Large gatherings remain banned until at least August 31, and the Austrian government is still working on plans for theatres to resume while respecting social distancing rules. The Junior Minister for Culture stepped down after increasing pressure from theatre directors and performers over the lack of urgency in reopening cultural venues, even as the lockdown in Austria is eased. The resignation is critical to the left-wing Green party, who has been under fire for their limited role as a counterweight to their coalition partner,  Chancellor Kurzís conservative party.</p>
