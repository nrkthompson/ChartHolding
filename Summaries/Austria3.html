      The Austrian government announced a new phase of fewer restrictions and more individual responsibility for its citizens, following fewer than 50 new infections in the last few weeks. Gyms, swimming pools, camping sites, hotels, zoos, and cinemas reopened under strict social distancing and hygiene measures. Effective June 15, nose and mouth coverings will no longer be mandatory in shops, schools, and tourist areas. However, facial coverings will remain mandatory on public transit, in health facilities, including pharmacies  and in service institutions where social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as hairdressers, and restaurants.  In restaurants,  restrictions on the number of people per table will end along with the extension of opening hours from 11 pm to 1 am. Related to border controls, on June 4 quarantines will no longer be required when entering Austria from its 7 neighbouring countries, excluding Italy. The Foreign Minister is advising citizens to refrain from unnecessary travel and to holiday within Austria despite reopening. The Health Ministry approved safety conditions for Austria to host two Formula One Grand Prix races on July 5th and 12th without spectators and with limited numbers of people involved.
