      Israel has witnessed an uptick in new cases over recent weeks, occasionally exceeding 200 confirmed cases per day. Many of the increases are concentrated in schools, sending thousands of students and teachers home for quarantine. Big cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem continue to be transmission hotspots. The Israeli health ministry has been permitted to accept Gilead Sciences’ donation of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. While all other reopening plans have been frozen, the cap on the number of people attending weddings and some religious rites was raised to 250 people on June 14. A phone number list of all participants must be kept for 20 days. Other events can only accommodate a maximum of 50 people, as previously established. Schools continue to be open to all students. The government is considering re-imposing some restrictive measures, about which few details have been provided.
