      Quebec has over half of the positive COVID-19 cases in Canada. As of June 21, Quebec still reported more than approximately 100 new cases daily and multiple deaths; however, the number of hospitalizations and ICU patients has decreased for weeks.  The government is encouraging capacity limits, handwashing, and masks. On June 22, Quebec and Montreal progressed in easing some COVID-19 health restrictions. Like the rest of the province, people in the Greater Montreal Area can have gatherings of maximum 10 people from three different households. As well, dine-in restaurants, mall food courts, gyms, indoor pools, public and private beaches, arenas, religious places, concert halls, theatres, cinemas, and day camps have reopened with restrictions. Long-term care facilities may allow visitors. Montrealâ€™s airport will require masks, take temperatures, only allow passengers and employees to enter, check passengers for symptoms at checkpoints, reserve parking online, conduct self check-in and baggage drop, and increase hand washing and sanitizing stations. Self-isolation in Quebec is not required after interprovincial travel.
