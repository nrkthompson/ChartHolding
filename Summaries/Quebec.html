  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 13, masks will be mandatory on public transit. However, police will not enforce the rule, bus drivers do not want to enforce the rule, and there will not be fines for breaking this rule. The Quebec government is considering strategies to test asymptomatic carriers, to investigate regional testing and to implement testing at Quebec-US borders. As the military withdrawal from Quebec’s care homes is almost complete, 10,000 orderly students hired for medical support during the pandemic have finished school and will now enter Quebec’s health sector. The health minister warned businesses that if they fail to comply with public health regulations, they will be closed. This warning was specifically directed towards bars, and was followed by a threat to reintroduce lockdown measures for that sector. On July 10, the province implemented a number of new rules for bars. Serving hours have been reduced (must close by 1am) and there can be a maximum of 50% capacity. No dancing is permitted, all customers must be seated, and bars must collect a register of customer contact information or have one guest in each group be the contact person for that group.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 13, Quebecers will have to wear masks on public transit. Places of worship and amusement parks reopened across Quebec on June 30. Restaurants in Montreal were permitted to reopen the week of June 22, and since then there have been complaints about restaurant failures to abide by new health regulations. On July 3, eight Cineplex locations reopened in Quebec with sanitation measures. The Quebec Tourism Department explained that police will be responsible for enforcing public safety and COVID-19 rules, but to manage tourism, additional security and no-parking signs will be used. The reopening of casinos is staggered between mid-July and early August, and will include precautions such as rubber tipped pens, masks, reduced hours, increased cleaning, and closed bars and showrooms. On June 30, the Quebec government said that in September all schools would resume in person at normal capacity for elementary and high school students. Subgroups of students will be created to promote social distancing. The government encourages CEGEPs and universities to resume in person. The education ministry is preparing a plan for a possible second wave. Some parents whose children previously returned to elementary schools outside of Montreal reported positive experiences of increased social distancing, sanitation mechanisms, and rules that closed gyms and cafeterias.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quebec has over half of the positive COVID-19 cases in Canada. As of June 21, Quebec still reported more than approximately 100 new cases daily and multiple deaths; however, the number of hospitalizations and ICU patients has decreased for weeks.  The government is encouraging capacity limits, handwashing, and masks. On June 22, Quebec and Montreal progressed in easing some COVID-19 health restrictions. Like the rest of the province, people in the Greater Montreal Area can have gatherings of maximum 10 people from three different households. As well, dine-in restaurants, mall food courts, gyms, indoor pools, public and private beaches, arenas, religious places, concert halls, theatres, cinemas, and day camps have reopened with restrictions. Long-term care facilities may allow visitors. Montreal’s airport will require masks, take temperatures, only allow passengers and employees to enter, check passengers for symptoms at checkpoints, reserve parking online, conduct self check-in and baggage drop, and increase hand washing and sanitizing stations. Self-isolation in Quebec is not required after interprovincial travel.</p>
