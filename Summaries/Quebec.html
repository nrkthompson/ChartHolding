  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 12, Quebec reported for a third consecutive day of less than 100 new daily cases. Quebec’s premier reiterated that students will be returning in-person in the fall and addressed their new back to school plan. The new plan has students in grades five and up wearing masks in common areas but not in classrooms.  The plan no longer has bubbles of six students within the class but instead makes the entire class the social bubble. On August 11, Premier Legault said that there would certainly be a second wave but that it would not be as bad as the first wave because Quebec prepared for it by hiring orderlies, acknowledging the importance of PPE, and ensuring that there would be many tests available. Opposition parties and some unions have criticized the government for omitting details from their plan and for failing to address how students will catch up academically. Opposition parties in Quebec have not been eager about supporting the federal COVID Alert contact tracing app or about developing an app specific to Quebec.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 6, Quebec’s five-day average of new cases was 135. This is the lowest that it has been since approximately mid-July. The majority of new cases are located in Montreal. Since events of up to 250 people are permitted, festivals and events in Quebec may resume with social distancing and masks. Survey results indicate that approximately half of Quebecers are afraid to return to work. The government is facing a potential court challenge from a constitutional lawyer arguing that children should be given the option to return to online studies in the fall. A teachers union in Quebec is calling for the delay of school until after Labour Day. The union also raises questions about poor ventilation in schools, classes with windows that do not open, and whether masks will be mandatory and who will supply them. Quebec’s public health director said that it is unlikely that Quebec will impose a partial lockdown in the event of a second wave because of the negative impacts for the elderly and youth.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">27 people developed COVID-19 during an outbreak at a day camp in Boucherville en Montérégie at the Les Ateliers de Charlot l'Escargot camp, which led to the closure of camp from July 20 to August 7. Smaller outbreaks were reported at camps in Monteregie, Gatineau and Montreal. The government is concerned about a trend toward hosting large parties regardless of gathering limits among individuals age 15-34. As of August 3, the limit indoors for performance halls, theaters, cinemas, religious services and community halls increased from 50 to 250 with protective measures and distancing in place. Schools, colleges and universities are expected to reopen in September. The Quebec government will collaborate with CEGEPs and universities to discourage parties and plan for rapid interventions if there is an outbreak.  Schools will have social bubbles and will have teachers rotate through classrooms instead of students. Students in Grades 10 and 11 will have the option to study in person or remotely. Officials also said that the recent increase in personnel and PPE in long term care homes is allowing them to improve in the areas where they struggled most during the first wave.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 20, Quebec reported stable infection rates despite outbreaks at a healthcare facility and at four bars. On July 21, Quebec reported 180 new cases -- their highest increase since June 12. Over half of the new cases are in Montreal. Officials suspect that their slight increase in cases is due to increased testing and explain that their rate of positive tests has remained around 2% and the number of hospitalizations has remained steady or decreased. However, officials are worried about reports of private gatherings. The Grand Prix cycling races scheduled for September in Montreal and Quebec City have been cancelled. Gathering limits in indoor public places will increase from 50 to 250 people on August 3. Although preschools and elementary schools outside of the Montreal Metropolitan community (CMM) have been open since May 11, schools in the CMM will remain closed until late August. With some exceptions, secondary schools across Quebec are also expected to remain closed until the end of August. McGill University expressed some concerns about international students returning to campus and residence for the fall semester.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Masks became mandatory in public spaces across Quebec on July 13. After requesting that everyone who worked in or visited a bar in Montreal after July 1 get tested, the Quebec government is looking to increase Montreal’s testing capacity to accommodate demand. Experts have suggested that many of Quebec’s new COVID-19 cases are connected to the reopening of bars, restaurants, pools and stores. There have also been issues with people forgetting who they had been in close contact with. The Quebec government noted that increases in cases could be tied to private gatherings and bars. Officials are concerned after the positivity rate of COVID-19 tests was found to be over 3% last weekend, after being under 1% earlier this month. As of July 18, office employees (including non-essential workers) could return to offices with COVID-19 measures in place and a capacity limit of 25%, with the capacity limit expected to increase in the future. Criticism has been raised over the province’s reopening of bars and other nightlife, which is risking a spike in cases that may prevent schools from reopening in September. A widely circulated gender equality consultant’s op-ed suggested that a continued school closure would disproportionately affect women and lower-income children.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 13, masks will be mandatory on public transit. However, police will not enforce the rule, bus drivers do not want to enforce the rule, and there will not be fines for breaking this rule. The Quebec government is considering strategies to test asymptomatic carriers, to investigate regional testing and to implement testing at Quebec-US borders. As the military withdrawal from Quebec’s care homes is almost complete, 10,000 orderly students hired for medical support during the pandemic have finished school and will now enter Quebec’s health sector. The health minister warned businesses that if they fail to comply with public health regulations, they will be closed. This warning was specifically directed towards bars, and was followed by a threat to reintroduce lockdown measures for that sector. On July 10, the province implemented a number of new rules for bars. Serving hours have been reduced (must close by 1am) and there can be a maximum of 50% capacity. No dancing is permitted, all customers must be seated, and bars must collect a register of customer contact information or have one guest in each group be the contact person for that group.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 13, Quebecers will have to wear masks on public transit. Places of worship and amusement parks reopened across Quebec on June 30. Restaurants in Montreal were permitted to reopen the week of June 22, and since then there have been complaints about restaurant failures to abide by new health regulations. On July 3, eight Cineplex locations reopened in Quebec with sanitation measures. The Quebec Tourism Department explained that police will be responsible for enforcing public safety and COVID-19 rules, but to manage tourism, additional security and no-parking signs will be used. The reopening of casinos is staggered between mid-July and early August, and will include precautions such as rubber tipped pens, masks, reduced hours, increased cleaning, and closed bars and showrooms. On June 30, the Quebec government said that in September all schools would resume in person at normal capacity for elementary and high school students. Subgroups of students will be created to promote social distancing. The government encourages CEGEPs and universities to resume in person. The education ministry is preparing a plan for a possible second wave. Some parents whose children previously returned to elementary schools outside of Montreal reported positive experiences of increased social distancing, sanitation mechanisms, and rules that closed gyms and cafeterias.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Quebec has over half of the positive COVID-19 cases in Canada. As of June 21, Quebec still reported more than approximately 100 new cases daily and multiple deaths; however, the number of hospitalizations and ICU patients has decreased for weeks.  The government is encouraging capacity limits, handwashing, and masks. On June 22, Quebec and Montreal progressed in easing some COVID-19 health restrictions. Like the rest of the province, people in the Greater Montreal Area can have gatherings of maximum 10 people from three different households. As well, dine-in restaurants, mall food courts, gyms, indoor pools, public and private beaches, arenas, religious places, concert halls, theatres, cinemas, and day camps have reopened with restrictions. Long-term care facilities may allow visitors. Montreal’s airport will require masks, take temperatures, only allow passengers and employees to enter, check passengers for symptoms at checkpoints, reserve parking online, conduct self check-in and baggage drop, and increase hand washing and sanitizing stations. Self-isolation in Quebec is not required after interprovincial travel.</p>
