      On May 17, the Czech government ended its official nationwide state of emergency, while leaving a number of emergency measures in place. All Czech residents travelling outside of their homes, with some exceptions, such as children under the age of two,  are still required to cover their faces using a scarf or mask until at least May 25. All primary and secondary schools will remain closed until at least May 25, with the exception of students writing final exams or post-secondary entry examinations. Some post-secondary classes and group activities are being allowed to take place in-person, provided that there are no more than 15 students in a room at one time. The fourth and final phase of easing lockdown restrictions in the country are expected to begin on May 25, and will include the reopening of all indoor catering establishments, hotels, and public swimming pools (indoor and outdoor). Mass gatherings of up to 300 people will also be allowed in both indoor and outdoor settings.
