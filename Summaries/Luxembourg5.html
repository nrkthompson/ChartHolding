      On June 15, all playgrounds reopened to  children, with no compulsory requirement to wear masks for those under the age of 13. Restaurants can host ten people at one table. Gatherings of people are no longer limited, but groups exceeding twenty people will have to adhere to stricter safety regulations. Outdoor and indoor events with more than twenty people can be organised, as long as there are designated seats for all participants. Safety distances of 2 metres must be assured, or people are obliged to wear masks.  However, effective 16 June, it is no longer a legal requirement to wear a protective mask in a car, but it is compulsory on public transport due to crowding. In an announcement on the following day, RyanAir, announced the resumption of flights from Luxembourg Airport to 10 destinations abroad, effective July. The relaunch of flights, however, remains dependent on travel authorisations by each country. However, flights to Germany are available given that it re-opened all its borders with Luxembourg for all types of travel on June 16.
