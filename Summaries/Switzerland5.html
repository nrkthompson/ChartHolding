      Switzerland reopened its borders, lifting the remaining travel restrictions for countries in the EU and Schengen zone. While no quarantine is necessary upon arrival, these entry rules and conditions are subject to change depending on epidemiological situations in the countries. Presently, no travellers can enter from Spain. No announcements have been made for countries not included, but further easing of border restrictions for incoming guests from outside these areas are expected on July 6 at the latest.  The Federal Office of Public Health stated that specific rules may apply for “certain groups of people or for certain types of journeys under specific conditions.” These conditions may include mandatory quarantines or proof of a negative test. On June 17, Switzerland’s COVID-19 reproduction rate (R0) rose above one, prompting concerns that the country is prematurely ending its lockdown. “The news [about their reproduction rate (R0) over one] contradicts official claims that the country is winning the battle against the spread of COVID-19” and could be a warning sign for a second wave of infections.
