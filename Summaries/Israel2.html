      Israel has maintained a low level of new COVID-19 infections - fewer than 30 per day - and very few new deaths. A ministerial committee has been established as the supreme coordinating body to handle the pandemic and formulate plans for a possible second wave. The Israeli cabinet decided to limit the involvement of spy agencies in contact tracing only to infected people on May 24, stating the priority of epidemiological investigation. Effective May 27, restaurants, bars, swimming pools, hotels and tourist attractions can resume operations, conditional on the observance of physical distancing, hygiene rules, and wearing masks. Seating in food courts in malls is still restricted. The physical distancing requirement in museums has been halved to 1 visitor per 7 square meters. Up to 50 people can be present in gatherings in open areas. Bus operation at 75% capacity was permitted this week, and trains will resume full activities from June 8. 2 passengers are allowed to join the driver in a private vehicle. There are now no specific restrictions on the number of workers at the workplace as long as infection prevention rules are followed, and a maximum of 50 people can be present at professional meetings. The entry ban for university and religious academic program students who do not hold Israeli passports has been relaxed to facilitate studies completion, and the educational institutions involved have to support students’ self-isolation.
