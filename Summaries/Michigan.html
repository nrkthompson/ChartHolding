  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Michigan’s 7-day average of new infections has increased significantly in the past four weeks from 160 to 620 new cases per day. Governor Gretchen Whitmer stated that if the trend continued to increase and community spread persisted, she would move some regions back to phase three, which would prohibit in-person instruction when schools are expected to start in 55 days. She continues to urge Michiganders to wear masks. Whitmer closed indoor bar services last week after outbreaks were linked to bars in East Lansing, Royal Oak and Romulus and a rise in positive cases in the 20-29 age group.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of confirmed cases have continued to increase in Michigan, prompting Governor Gretchen Whitmer to enact an executive order on face masks. This took effect on July 13. Under the order, Michiganders are required to wear a face mask in indoor public spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, where it is not possible maintain proper social distancing. Those who violate the order will face a $500 fine. At least 4,000 students have signed up for voluntary summer school in Detroit, with more than half choosing the face-to-face option. On July 13, Detroit Public School Board became the first school board in the state to try a combination of in-person and remote learning. For K-8, classes will be made up of 15 students per in-person class and 25 students per virtual classroom. Students will arrive at staggered times to ensure as little contact as possible. High school students will primarily stick to virtual learning for recovering credits lost by a school year cut short earlier in 2020. Critics say that the Superintendent, Mayor, and Governor are using Detroit public school students--mainly Black, Arab and Latino--as an immunity experiment, increasing their risk of contracting the virus.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although the state reported zero deaths on July 5 for the first time since March 20, the 7-day average of positive cases jumped from 290 to 373 last week. This prompted Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to announce that the state will not advance to the fifth phase of the state’s reopening plan by the Fourth of July weekend, as she had originally planned. Phase five would expand indoor dining services, permit larger gatherings, and open more businesses.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the recent uptick in cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions, Michigan is no longer on track to "contain" COVID-19. There have been a few outbreaks traced back to nursing homes, bars and athletic facilities. On June 25, the mayor of Detroit threatened to shut down bars and restaurants that continue to violate COVID-19 regulations. Similar to Ontario, there have been outbreaks tied to migrant farm workers in the state. Governor Whitmer has attempted to address the problem with an executive order requiring migrant housing operators to separate worker beds by at least six feet when possible and encourage workers to sleep head-to-toe. The order also requires isolation units for sick workers and other safeguards. However, inspectors say that the rules have not always been followed by farms and workers due to fear of competition and job loss, respectively.</p>
