  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although the state reported zero deaths on July 5 for the first time since March 20, the 7-day average of positive cases jumped from 290 to 373 last week. This prompted Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to announce that the state will not advance to the fifth phase of the stateâ€™s reopening plan by the Fourth of July weekend, as she had originally planned. Phase five would expand indoor dining services, permit larger gatherings, and open more businesses.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the recent uptick in cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions, Michigan is no longer on track to "contain" COVID-19. There have been a few outbreaks traced back to nursing homes, bars and athletic facilities. On June 25, the mayor of Detroit threatened to shut down bars and restaurants that continue to violate COVID-19 regulations. Similar to Ontario, there have been outbreaks tied to migrant farm workers in the state. Governor Whitmer has attempted to address the problem with an executive order requiring migrant housing operators to separate worker beds by at least six feet when possible and encourage workers to sleep head-to-toe. The order also requires isolation units for sick workers and other safeguards. However, inspectors say that the rules have not always been followed by farms and workers due to fear of competition and job loss, respectively.</p>
