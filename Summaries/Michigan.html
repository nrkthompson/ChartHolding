  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Michigan’s seven-day moving average has increased to 870 new cases per day, its highest point since April. The state has reported an increase in COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the last two weeks. On September 18, 481 were hospitalized with COVID-19, whereas 674 were hospitalized on September 30. On October 2, the Michigan Supreme Court struck down the Governor’s emergency powers, rendering all executive orders regarding COVID-19 past April 30 unconstitutional without approval from Michigan’s GOP-led House and Senate. This effectively terminates all remaining restrictions and precautionary measures related to COVID-19 in the state, until the Governor reaches a deal with the state legislature. Accordingly, this next week will be crucial to determine the trajectory of the state.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Michigan’s epidemiological situation appears to be stabilizing for now, as the state continues to report seven-day moving averages of 700-800 new cases per day. On September 25, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed two executive orders regarding COVID-19. The first one tackles education, requiring all students K-12 to wear masks inside classrooms starting October 5, and schools must now notify the public when there are cases among students or staff as soon as they’re confirmed by local health departments. The second executive order tackles reopening, allowing indoor cinemas, performance venues, arcades, bingo halls, bowling alleys, indoor climbing facilities and trampoline parks to reopen statewide starting October 9 with occupancy limits to ensure six feet of distance between non-household members.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The stateís seven-day moving average is approximately 700 new cases per day.  The test positivity rate is 2.5%. On September 9, Governor Gretchen Whitmer allowed indoor services at gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, roller rinks, ice rinks, swimming pools and similar businesses to reopen at 25% capacity. However, this week Whitmer said that a backwards step is possible for Upper Michigan based on the stateís recent increase in numbers.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The stateís seven-day moving average has stabilized at around 700 new cases per day. On September 9, Governor Gretchen Whitmer allowed indoor services at gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, roller rinks, ice rinks, swimming pools and similar businesses to reopen at 25% capacity. She strongly suggested using outdoor fitness classes when available. The wearing of face coverings at all times is required except when swimming. Face shields are not sufficient. Businesses who do not enforce these rules could be fined $7,000 by local law enforcement. Cultural and entertainment institutions, such as movie theatres, remain closed.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Michiganís seven-day moving average is now at 582 new cases per day. As of August 20, Michigan health officials reported 14 COVID-19 outbreaks at K-12 schools and universities. While some districts started the school year offering in-person classes, the overwhelming majority of districts are starting it virtually or adopting a hybrid style. Although the state allows outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people, Washtenaw County has restricted outdoor gatherings in Ann Arbor to 25 people due to increased risks of transmission.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The stateís seven-day moving average is now just more than 750 new cases per day. Michigan lawmakers are firming up a framework for schools to get kids back to the classroom this fall - whether itís in-person, virtual or some mix of both. The Michigan Senate passed bipartisan legislation on August 15 leaving it to local districts to determine reopening methods and guidelines. Districts could take local COVID-19 metrics and recommendations from individual health departments into account. While most are encouraged to rely on virtual learning, school boards will be required to review their districtís instruction plans on a monthly basis and provide opportunity for public comment before re-certifying the method of instruction or making any changes.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">New cases have begun plateauing in Michigan, stabilizing at 660 daily cases. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she is ìtrying to avoidî moving the state back a phase in the reopening plan, before schools resume on August 26. Michigan will not have a uniform, statewide K-12 reopening plan this school year for its 544 traditional school districts and nearly 300 public school academies. Instead, each district is required to have a plan approved and in place by August 17. Gov. Whitmer has voiced concerns about schools reopening to in-person instruction this fall and has opposed proposals to mandate it. A majority of districts will adopt 100% online learning, with limited in-person options for K-8 students.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Michiganís 7-day moving average for daily cases as of August 1 was 768, the highest since early May. On July 29, Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive order to reimpose restrictions in Regions 6 and 8, which include the Upper Peninsula and 17 counties in northern Michigan; the restrictions cap indoor gatherings at 10 people and completely close indoor bars where alcohol accounts for 70% of sales. However, Whitmer allowed for Detroit's casinos to reopen at 15% capacity on August 5.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Michiganís 7-day average for new infections continues to increase.  It now hovers around 680 new cases per day. The chairman of the Michigan Economic Recovery Council said it was ìprobably inevitableî that the entire state would need to regress to Phase 3 of its reopening plan, meaning no gatherings, no in-person education, and limiting non-essential retail to curbside or delivery. However, no official announcements by Governor Gretchen Whitmer have been made yet. On July 24, the Governor issued an executive order reinforcing temporary restrictions on entry into long term care facilities and juvenile justice facilities. Earlier this month, the Governor closed bars and indoor dining after opening them in June. Cross-Border Institute director Bill Anderson said that the Trump administration had no appetite to touch on the border closure issue until after the U.S. election.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Michiganís 7-day average of new infections has increased significantly in the past four weeks from 160 to 620 new cases per day. Governor Gretchen Whitmer stated that if the trend continued to increase and community spread persisted, she would move some regions back to phase three, which would prohibit in-person instruction when schools are expected to start in 55 days. She continues to urge Michiganders to wear masks. Whitmer closed indoor bar services last week after outbreaks were linked to bars in East Lansing, Royal Oak and Romulus and a rise in positive cases in the 20-29 age group.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of confirmed cases have continued to increase in Michigan, prompting Governor Gretchen Whitmer to enact an executive order on face masks. This took effect on July 13. Under the order, Michiganders are required to wear a face mask in indoor public spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, where it is not possible maintain proper social distancing. Those who violate the order will face a $500 fine. At least 4,000 students have signed up for voluntary summer school in Detroit, with more than half choosing the face-to-face option. On July 13, Detroit Public School Board became the first school board in the state to try a combination of in-person and remote learning. For K-8, classes will be made up of 15 students per in-person class and 25 students per virtual classroom. Students will arrive at staggered times to ensure as little contact as possible. High school students will primarily stick to virtual learning for recovering credits lost by a school year cut short earlier in 2020. Critics say that the Superintendent, Mayor, and Governor are using Detroit public school students--mainly Black, Arab and Latino--as an immunity experiment, increasing their risk of contracting the virus.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Although the state reported zero deaths on July 5 for the first time since March 20, the 7-day average of positive cases jumped from 290 to 373 last week. This prompted Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to announce that the state will not advance to the fifth phase of the stateís reopening plan by the Fourth of July weekend, as she had originally planned. Phase five would expand indoor dining services, permit larger gatherings, and open more businesses.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the recent uptick in cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions, Michigan is no longer on track to "contain" COVID-19. There have been a few outbreaks traced back to nursing homes, bars and athletic facilities. On June 25, the mayor of Detroit threatened to shut down bars and restaurants that continue to violate COVID-19 regulations. Similar to Ontario, there have been outbreaks tied to migrant farm workers in the state. Governor Whitmer has attempted to address the problem with an executive order requiring migrant housing operators to separate worker beds by at least six feet when possible and encourage workers to sleep head-to-toe. The order also requires isolation units for sick workers and other safeguards. However, inspectors say that the rules have not always been followed by farms and workers due to fear of competition and job loss, respectively.</p>
