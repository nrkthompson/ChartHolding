  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">From July 31, foreigners travelling to Hungary from countries with a “yellow” or “red” rating will be required to pay for their own COVID-19 tests if should they choose to take one instead of a mandatory 2-week quarantine upon arrival in Hungary. Foreigners entering Hungary are required to undergo a medical examination upon arrival at the border--after which they receive an order for mandatory quarantine, and a red card, which they are required to affix to the door of their apartment while in isolation. If travellers wish to be exempted from quarantine, they can submit an application for testing– costing three thousand forints–to a district office, which may or may not approve their request to leave quarantine for the duration of testing.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Operational staff responsible for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Hungary have asked that local police step up their efforts to monitor compliance with mandatory quarantine and stay-at-home orders. Authorities cited the reintroduction of COVID-19 from abroad as the country’s greatest threat with respect to the virus.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 16, the Minister of the Hungarian Prime Minister’s Office announced that public celebrations of State Foundation Day on August 20 will be cancelled due to the ongoing risk of holding mass events during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Hungary has changed its risk classifications for Canada and Portugal to “yellow,” and “green”, respectively. This means that Canadians can now enter Hungary subject to a physiological assessment upon arrival and a mandatory 14-day quarantine.  Portuguese citizens can travel to Hungary without restrictions.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following a resurgence in cases of COVID-19 throughout Eastern Europe, Hungary has temporarily reintroduced travel restrictions with a number of countries. On July 12, Hungary’s government began sorting countries into 3 categories – red, yellow, and green – based on their rates of new coronavirus infections. Foreigners from countries in the “red” category – including Albania, Ukraine, Belarus, and most of Asia, Africa, and Latin America – are banned from entering, while Hungarian citizens travelling from those locations will have to quarantine for two weeks upon their return, or until they have tested negative for COVID-19 twice in the span of 48 hours. Both Hungarians and foreigners travelling from countries in the “yellow” category – which includes Britain, Russia, the US, and Sweden – will be required to quarantine for two weeks, or after testing negative for COVID-19 upon arrival in Hungary. On July 13, all international passenger transport via rail between Hungary and Serbia was suspended until further notice.</p>

  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 18, the Hungarian government ended its nationwide state of emergency and entered a state of “epidemiological preparedness,” thereby lifting many of the restrictions introduced in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.

Mass gatherings can now take place with up to 500 participants. The Hungarian Football Association has been allowed to lift all restrictions and security measures concerning domestic football matches. This means that all matches can take place without restrictions, and all clubs can fully reopen their stands at full capacity. All healthcare services have been allowed to resume, and the inpatients of all medical facilities and social centres can now accept visitors without restrictions. Hungarian citizens and permanent residents can now return to Hungary from any country, and may enter the country without a mandatory period of quarantine.
