  <p style="text-align:justify;">Hungary’s government has imposed a number of precautionary measures in recent days in order to prevent a major resurgence of the COVID-19 in the coming weeks and months.

Foreign nationals with permanent Hungarian residency (and their close family members), as well as those who hold a permit of stay for more than 90 days, will be treated the same way as Hungarian citizens. Foreigners are banned from entering the country, with the exception of Czech, Polish, and Slovak citizens who have booked accommodation in Hungary before September 1 and who are able to produce a negative COVID-19 test within five days of their arrival in Hungary. Exceptions to the ban will be made for foreigners on official business involving state organizations, those certified to receive healthcare, students with proof of student status, lorry drivers returning home, visitors taking part in family events such as weddings, and participants of international sporting, cultural, or religious events.

Until their results arrive, they are only permitted to travel between their home and training venues. If a foreign team travels to Hungary from a country with a yellow or red rating, its players and coaching staff must submit upon arrival two negative COVID-19 tests taken at least 48 hours apart and not older than 5 days.</p>

Foreigners entering Hungary are required to undergo a medical examination upon arrival at the border--after which they receive an order for mandatory quarantine, and a red card, which they are required to affix to the door of their apartment while in isolation. If travellers wish to be exempted from quarantine, they can submit an application for testing– costing three thousand forints–to a district office, which may or may not approve their request to leave quarantine for the duration of testing.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Operational staff responsible for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Hungary have asked that local police step up their efforts to monitor compliance with mandatory quarantine and stay-at-home orders.

  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 16, the Minister of the Hungarian Prime Minister’s Office announced that public celebrations of State Foundation Day on August 20 will be cancelled due to the ongoing risk of holding mass events during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Foreigners from countries in the “red” category – including Albania, Ukraine, Belarus, and most of Asia, Africa, and Latin America – are banned from entering, while Hungarian citizens travelling from those locations will have to quarantine for two weeks upon their return, or until they have tested negative for COVID-19 twice in the span of 48 hours. Both Hungarians and foreigners travelling from countries in the “yellow” category – which includes Britain, Russia, the US, and Sweden – will be required to quarantine for two weeks, or after testing negative for COVID-19 upon arrival in Hungary. On July 13, all international passenger transport via rail between Hungary and Serbia was suspended until further notice.</p>
