      On June 15, non-essential travel resumed within the EU and Schengen zone. While arrivals are not subject to quarantine, airports have implemented measures which include temperature checks before departure and mandatory face coverings. Non-essential travel outside of the EU and Schengen zone remains banned. The distribution of face masks ordered by the federal government began on June 15, more than a month after the initial pledge to provide each resident with a mask. Over a 10 day period, 4,800 pharmacies will be responsible for distributing masks in stages organized by age group. A government decision to distribute 10 free rail tickets to all Belgians has been publicly opposed by the National Rail Company. The companyâ€™s board of directors agrees it would endanger the safety and health of passengers and staff and plans to postpone implementation of the decision to a later date when public health conditions improve. Two nursing federations are taking the government to court after accusing authorities of negligence toward health care staff and a lack of foresight in their management of COVID-19. The Interior Minister urged local officials to limit the right to protest in the interest of public health, in order to avoid a potential second wave.
