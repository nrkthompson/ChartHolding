      Despite a gradual lift in restrictions, COVID-19 lockdown fatigue is spreading rapidly throughout Germany. On May 16th, more than 10,000  unsatisfied citizens protested against Chancellor Merkel's "Corona Dictatorship," with even larger protests expected this weekend. The Federation's far-right opposition party (AfD) has been mobilizing and capitalizing on these protests. Protestors include anti-vaxxers, neo-Nazis, anti-capitalists, and ordinary citizens concerned about job losses, and safety at reopened nurseries and schools. Restaurants across Germany, including Berlin, are now allowed to receive guests between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. However, in many tourist and financial districts, restaurants remain closed due to the lack of demand. Restaurant clients are encouraged to write down their contact details to allow for contact tracing, and sign a paper saying that they conform to the law, freeing restaurant owners from liability, should the police check. Contact details are then destroyed after four weeks, prompting environmental concerns about paper waste. On May 19th, Germany and France announced a blueprint for a €500 billion recovery fund, which will offer grants to help countries, regions, and sectors within the EU. This is seen as a departure from Merkel's typical frugality regarding grants in lieu of loans, and she will need to lobby her own party to support the fund. Nordic and Eastern European countries have begun criticizing the plan, ahead of planned debates at the European Parliament.
