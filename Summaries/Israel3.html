      Israel has seen an uptick in case over the past week, with daily increases occasionally exceeding 100. A cluster of outbreaks at schools have aroused nationwide concerns, sending thousands of students and teachers home. After a month of delays, the widespread antibody testing started last week to help determine the population’s exposure to the virus. A pilot program was launched in regions with high infection rates. Some 70,000 people are set to be tested initially. Early results indicated that the infection rate might be greater than previously thought, with a greater chance of carriers with no symptoms.  As of May 30, drive-in compounds have been used at multiple locations to conduct testing on designated people. To help reach their target of 100,000 tests per day, various companies are working on new testing kits that produce results within a minute. As reopening progresses, some of the last remaining businesses that were closed are now permitted to resume, this includes restaurants, hotels, pools and other establishments. Temperature checks are required before entering restaurants. Places like cinemas are set to open in mid-June. Men’s professional soccer resumed on May 30 without spectators. All schools resumed full activities as of May 31. An order was signed to allow higher education systems to have increased activities like in-person lessons and examinations. Universities and colleges are displeased with the lack of preparation time.
