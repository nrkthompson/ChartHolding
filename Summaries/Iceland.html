      Up to 500 people are now able to gather in Iceland in the country’s most recent lifting of restrictions, with fitness centres and swimming pools able to return to full capacity. Over 900 air passengers arrived in Iceland on June 15 after the country allowed access to tourists from the EU/EEA, of whom two tested positive for coronavirus and are now in isolation. The government issued new guidelines for tourists who opt to quarantine rather than get tested at the airport, saying they are subject to deportation for violating the rules and may deny them entry if they are deemed to be likely violators. The Director of Health said that the country would be able to carry on testing for COVID-19 even if nurses go on strike on June 22, as other healthcare professionals can perform the test. The Head of the Nurses’ Union fought back against this assertion, saying that the Director’s statement undermines nursing as a profession and expressing her hope that other healthcare workers will not cross the picket line in the event of a strike.

      Nurses in Iceland have voted overwhelmingly in favour of indefinite strike action from June 22 if their union is unable to come to an agreement with the government. As a result, numerous hospital administrators have warned the government that they will be unable to operate if their nurses go on strike, complicating the plan to open borders to tourism on June 15. Iceland has altered its COVID-19 testing plan for tourists, rescinding the ability of international arrivals to provide their own certificate of a negative test to avoid self-isolating. Tourists will need to be tested upon arrival, or must submit to a mandatory two-week quarantine. Furthermore, Iceland has announced that it will not permit tourism for people from outside the EU/EEA until restrictions to the Schengen area as a whole are clarified. Those restrictions were previously scheduled to be lifted concurrently with Iceland’s, but the European Commission recently extended their duration until at least July 1. At the same time that border restrictions are loosened on June 15, Iceland will raise its gathering limit to 500 people (previous limit was 200).

      The reopening of borders on June 15 will go ahead as scheduled after the government stated last week that it was still attempting to figure out testing protocols for tourists. Tourists who do not wish to quarantine upon arrival will need to present a negative PCR test from the four days prior to arrival or a positive PCR test that is more than 14 days old. Nurses in Iceland are voting on strike action this week after working without a contract for more than a year. If approved, the strike is scheduled to begin on June 22 and will affect 2500 nurses at all public healthcare clinics just one week after borders to the country reopen.

      After most remaining lockdown restrictions were lifted on May 25, social distancing regulations have become optional rather than enforced. Absentee voting in Iceland’s presidential election is now underway, with citizens allowed to vote in-person over the next month at a number of different polling locations. Voting is being conducted in geographic stages, with those in the capital region going first, followed by more rural areas. The Minister of Health has said that the government will announce next week whether they will be able to proceed with the country’s planned opening of borders on June 15. This statement comes after questions have been raised about the government’s airport testing plan, as testing capacity and staffing levels remain low and the cost per test (which the government is planning to cover) remains high. Some revisions to the plan may be made, including shifting the cost of testing to tourists and recruiting private companies to help with testing capacity.

      The Icelandic government has said that gatherings of up to 200 people will be allowed from May 25th (previous limit was 50). On the same date, bars that do not serve food can reopen, but must close at 11pm, at the same time as the previously opened restaurant industry. Swimming pools were permitted to reopen at half their regular capacity on May 18th, while fitness centres will be able to do the same on May 25th. Iceland will be capable of testing up to 1000 tourists per day following the reopening of the border on June 15th, and has said that the state will pay for the tests for the time being.
