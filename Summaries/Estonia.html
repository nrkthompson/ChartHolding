  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estonia has a two-week average of 41.1 new cases per 100,000 people, among the lowest infection rates in Europe as of October 26. A significant number of the recent cases have been imported from abroad, and public health officials said that they will continue to emphasize the testing of all foreign arrivals. Schools in Tallinn are expected to remain in part-time distance learning after the mid-term break despite prominent public health officials saying that they could return to full-time in-school learning. The government announced that only travelers from Norway may enter the country without undergoing a quarantine period due to rising infection rates across Europe. The late-night alcohol sales ban may be supplemented with a consumption restriction, after numerous accounts of people buying large quantities of alcohol just before the ban came into effect were reported.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estonia reported 203 new cases of COVID-19 between October 12 and October 18. The two-week average of new cases is 35.29 per 100,000 people, lower than it was last week. Authorities urged residents to continue exercising caution as recent lower numbers do not necessarily indicate a trend. A nationwide ban on the sale of alcohol between 12am and 7am has been extended until November 29. Asymptomatic travellers from Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland will not need to quarantine upon arrival if they have received a negative COVID-19 test result in the previous 48 hours. A test result is not required for those travelling from the same countries for essential purposes. Travellers from only three other countries in Europe do not need to quarantine upon their arrival: Cyprus, Greece, and Norway. The government will discuss shortening the quarantine requirement from 14 days to 10 days next week.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 13, the two-week average of new cases in Estonia is 44.77 per 100,000 people. There are 595 active cases, including 32 hospitalizations. The Estonian government changed their system for determining quarantine requirements for incoming travellers. No quarantine period is required for those coming from countries with an infection rate below 25 per 100,000 over the past two weeks, while quarantine is always required for travellers from countries with an infection rate above 50 per 100,000 over the past two weeks. For countries with an infection rate in between, no quarantine is required if their infection rate is below 1.1 times the infection rate in Estonia, and is required otherwise. The option of taking two COVID-19 tests to avoid the quarantine period remains an option for all travellers. The prime minister said that he does not support implementing new restrictions as long as Estonians are following the public health guidelines in place.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estonia reported 81 new cases of COVID-19 on October 1 in one of the country’s largest daily increases since the beginning of the pandemic. Public health officials in Estonia are strongly encouraging the use of masks nationwide. Despite the recommendation, mask use is not expected to become compulsory. The Estonian government has altered its direct flight restrictions. All flights will be permitted into Estonia if the infection rate in their country of origin is no more than double the EU average. As of October 2, this restriction would allow flights from all EU countries except France, Spain, and the Czech Republic. The threshold for quarantine requirements upon arrival remains the same: 25 per 100,000 over the past two weeks for Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland; 16 per 100,000 for all other countries. However, the government will discuss changing this threshold next week after the minister of social affairs said it was outdated due to the high infection rates throughout Europe. The foreign minister also said that the government hopes to re-establish the travel bubble with the other Baltic nations, but it requires reaching a level of epidemiological stability. Professional athletes arriving in Estonia no longer need to quarantine themselves if they test negative for COVID-19 in their country of origin and upon their arrival.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">67 new cases of COVID-19 were reported in Estonia on September 28. There are 570 active cases in the country, the highest since April 14. Cases in Ida-Viru County have surged over the past week, leading to a much higher per capita infection rate in the region than anywhere else in Estonia. A prominent doctor in the region said that some residents are afraid of disclosing symptoms to their workplace for fear of losing their job, and as a result, the actual infection rate is likely much higher than is being reported. The gathering limit at indoor events will be lowered nationwide from 1500 people to 750 people effective September 28, and organizers must continue to ensure that social distancing is maintained at all times during their event. Prime Minister Ratas said that if the infection rate continues to rise, the government would look into implementing new restrictions, including a mandatory mask policy. While members of the Scientific Council and the national government opposed the restrictions on schools put in place in Tallinn, a representative from the Health Board said that she felt they were appropriate given the severity of the situation. The mayor of Tallinn said that they will continue with the restrictions for as long as it takes to lower the infection rate in the city.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estonia reported 61 new cases of COVID-19 on September 19, the countryís largest daily increase since the beginning of April. Estonia increased its infection rate threshold for quarantine requirements to 25 new cases per 100,000 over the past two weeks for Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania. The changes only apply to those countries for now, with the Estonian government saying that this was due to a ëmutual level of trustí between the nations. Despite the changes to the quarantine threshold, starting on September 28 quarantine-free travel between Estonia and Finland will only be permitted if it is work-related. The Ministry of Education said that individual schools cannot impose greater restrictions than the ones recommended by the Health Board or Scientific Council. Complaints were made after a few students were sent home after schools saw that they had recently travelled to Italy -- at the time considered a ësafeí country by public health officials. A ban on the sale of alcohol between 10 pm and 10 am will be implemented nationally starting next weekend. Bans had already been in place in Ida-Viru and Harju Counties. Direct flights to Sweden and Norway were suspended this weekend when both countries passed Estoniaís threshold for restrictions. A rural municipality in Tartu County has implemented restrictions on the same scale as the national lockdown in the spring. However, the Chancellor of Justice said that local officials did not have the authority to implement such restrictions, saying that it is the sole authority of the Estonian Parliament to restrict fundamental freedoms.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">An outbreak in Tallinn has caused local officials to reintroduce some restrictions on schools. All secondary schools in the Estonian capital will move to distance learning, while schools for other age groups should continue to monitor the situation. However, the head of the governmentís Scientific Council, Irja Lutsar, has said that she disagrees with the new restrictions -- calling them ëdisproportionateí to the situation. Lutsar said that the local government in Tallinn should focus on limiting private parties, since most new cases are linked to them, not schools. The Mayor of Tallinn said that his decision was based on guidelines offered by the Health Board, the countryís public health agency. The Mayor said that he believed the city was attempting to anticipate the situation worsening. Officials in Estonia have been negotiating with Latvian and Lithuanian authorities over the maintenance of a ëBaltic Bubbleí allowing free travel between the three states. After the infection rate in Estonia and Lithuania rose above the Latvian threshold for travel restrictions, the Estonian foreign minister said that the terms of the agreement need to be adjusted. In addition, a rise in cases around the world has caused the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to advise against all international travel indefinitely.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estoniaís Minister of Culture said that all indoor capacity restrictions at seated cultural venues will be lifted in September. The Scientific Council recommended against this change last week, but the Minister said that this was due to a misunderstanding about the proposal. Estonia will allow travellers from high-risk countries to avoid a two-week quarantine period by getting tested twice upon arrival. Travellers will take their first test as soon as they arrive in the country, and then take another a week or two later. In the interim period they will be allowed to go to work or attend essential activities, but cannot go to social gatherings or school. The Ministry of Social Affairs is considering implementing a customer registration regulation for a number of indoor public spaces. An official from the Ministry said that this would be used to avoid implementing further restrictions and forcing businesses to close. The Minister of Education said that all students are expected to attend class on September 1. If one  student contracts the virus, their entire class will move to distance learning until the student has recovered. A former high-ranking official at the Health Board said that the government actively obstructed the Health Boardís decision-making process at the beginning of the pandemic. The government eventually set up the Scientific Council for advisory purposes, but has yet to appoint a representative from the Health Board to the Council.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite recent COVID-19 outbreaks, the Health Board said that Estonians do not need to worry because the outbreaks have been contained to local areas. Public health officials said they have been able to contact trace around 90% of newly discovered cases and the positivity rate of tests conducted has remained relatively stable. The Ministry of Education will release its school reopening guidelines by August 25, though they are recommendations for each school and are not mandated. The acting director of the Health Board said that her agency views outbreaks among schoolchildren as unlikely. Students return to school on September 1 and the school year is scheduled to proceed as normal. Authorities in Estonia are not expected to mandate mask-wearing, though they agreed that wearing them in crowded indoor spaces would be a reasonable precaution to take. The Minister of Culture has proposed removing capacity limits on indoor cultural events, though gathering limits remain in place. The Scientific Council said it did not support lifting capacity restrictions, but said it may make exceptions for certain events. The Foreign Minister said that the EU should revise its travel policies to emphasize testing in response to new outbreaks across the continent.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estonia reported 78 new cases of COVID-19 last week, recording the countryís largest weekly increase since late April. Most of the new cases are connected to an outbreak in Tartu, which started when a symptomatic person visited several public places. Alcohol sales in Tartu have been restricted after 11 pm, and the mayor has urged residents to avoid crowded and enclosed spaces if possible--and to wear a mask if they cannot. Despite the growing outbreak, the government and the Health Board agreed that it was not necessary to introduce a mandatory mask policy at this point, but said they may be useful when taking public transit. The Minister of Social Affairs said the coming weeks would be crucial in determining if the government needs to reintroduce restrictions. PM Ratas said that the government would likely focus any new restrictions locally. Travellers from Iceland, France, the Netherlands, and San Marino were added to the list of arrivals to Estonia who are required to self-isolate for two weeks on arrival. A total of 19 EU countries are now on the list--up from only six at the beginning of July.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of active cases in Estonia has risen to 69.  Most of these are associated with the outbreak in Tartu connected to a symptomatic person who visited several public places. Despite this, the Health Board of Estonia has said that the spread of COVID-19 remains under control, noting that the country has an infection rate that is among the lowest in the EU. Public health officials acknowledged that cases are likely to rise in the coming days due to the new outbreak. The Minister of Social Affairs said that any talk of re-establishing lockdown restrictions is premature. As case numbers rise across Europe, the Estonian government has advised citizens to avoid all international travel because rapidly-changing situations could result in flight cancellations and a potential self-isolation period upon their return. Restrictions on visitor capacity at casinos, nightclubs, and other nightlife institutions changed on August 1, removing the limit of 100 people in all cases and moving to a 50% capacity limit. Estonia extended its direct flight ban to and from high-risk countries until the end of August. The government said they would update the policy once a month to allow airlines more time to plan and prepare their operations.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Travellers entering Estonia from 11 EU countries must self-isolate for 14 days upon arriva, up from only six EU countries four weeks ago. For a country to be taken off the list, they must have fewer than 16 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks. The Minister of Culture said that capacity limits on nightclubs (maximum of 100 people) would be among the last restrictions to be lifted by the government. Numerous nightclub owners had appealed to the government to allow them to raise their capacity to 50% or 500 people, whichever was lower. The Ministry of Economic Affairs had previously said they supported the idea to raise capacity, but nightclubs fell under the Ministry of Cultureís portfolio. The Minister of Culture said that the government hoped to lift the remaining restrictions by early September, but public health officials would need to approve their plan. An infected person in Tartu visited a cinema, spa, nightclub, and shops while being symptomatic over the past week. The Health Board said that similar irresponsible behaviour could lead to another outbreak in the country.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estonia renewed restrictions mandating that all COVID-19 patients and those living with them not leave their place of residence until the patient has recovered. The restrictions are in place until September 30, and the only exception for patients is for a life-threatening situation. Persons living with a patient may leave to acquire daily necessities if they are not otherwise available. Not all schools in Estonia would close if there is a second wave of COVID-19 in the country. Cases will be assessed individually, and schools are expected to be in person when the new school year starts on September 1. Some educators have expressed concerns over the lack of information on what to do if there is an infected person at their school. Officials at the Health Board said that they are in short supply of PPE, projecting that they only have about a monthís stock if there is a large-scale second wave. The Minister of Public Administration denied that the country was running low. He said more was being procured and some things could be produced in Estonia.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Estonian government will ease gathering restrictions on July 15, allowing 1,500 people at indoor events and 2,000 people at outdoor events. Indoor events must be at 50% capacity or the specified number of people, whichever is lower. However, the Research Council said that the government should be more cautious in its approach to easing restrictions, as there are clear differences in how certain events can meet social distancing guidelines. Travellers from the UK no longer need to self-isolate on arrival in Estonia after the government raised its criteria to 16 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks. People who do need to self-isolate will have to test negative for COVID-19 twice, and their isolation must be ensured by their employer or the school they attend. Universities in Estonia are seeking further clarity from the government on how they can ensure that arriving international students self-isolate because they do not have the capacity to house each student separately. Estoniaís contact tracing app will be ready for download on a voluntary basis on August 20. The Minister of Social Affairs said that, while development of the app has taken longer than in some other countries, it will be a high-quality product that is not beset by some of the same privacy issues found on the Norwegian app, among others.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estonia dramatically loosened its gathering limits on July 1, allowing up to 1000 people to gather outdoors, and up to 500 people indoors (or at 50% capacity, whichever is lower). Croatia and the Czech Republic were added to the list of EU countries where travellers from them must self-isolate on arrival in Estonia. The government will allow unrestricted travel between all the third countries deemed safe by the EU, and will not require travellers to quarantine on arrival. Estonia is not requiring reciprocity from those governments, but negotiations are ongoing with each of them in an attempt to secure unrestricted travel for Estonians. Estonia will no longer be checking in on people who are expected to self-isolate when they enter the country. Travellers found to be violating the rules may be fined, but the government said that this measure was a last resort. Third country nationals coming to Estonia to work or study will be allowed to enter the country. Employers must arrange transport, testing and accommodation for their employees, and there is a mandatory two-week quarantine for all those coming from countries where the infection rate is greater than 16 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks. In contrast to other travellers, seasonal workers will be checked on by the state to ensure they are following quarantine protocols. Another prominent member of Estoniaís Health Board has resigned this week after detailing a fraught relationship with the government. However, the Minister of Social Affairs said the government preferred that he stay in office--in contrast to the outgoing Chief of the Health Board.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Following the resignation last week of the Chief of the Health Board, the government has expressed hope of finding her replacement in the next few months--in anticipation of a second wave of the virus. Authorities in Estonia are concerned that Midsummer holiday festivities will lead to an uptick in cases, and police are monitoring certain events to ensure that guidelines are being followed. Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania were added to the list of countries where travellers need to self-isolate upon arrival in Estonia after their infection rates rose above 15 per 100,000 in the past two weeks. They join the UK, Sweden and Portugal. The Chair of the Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce said that the government has been indifferent to the plight of farmers who rely on seasonal foreign workers to harvest their crops. He added that initiatives to recruit locals have not worked, and only expanding eligibility to enter the country will alleviate the stress the industry is feeling.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estonia will lift its lockdown restrictions on nightclubs and bars on July 1. They will be limited to 50% capacity and a maximum of 100 people, and must adhere to disinfectant requirements. Additionally, the government announced that social distancing measures will become optional, effective immediately. In the interim, the Health Board has initiated criminal proceedings against the owners of multiple nightclubs in Tallinn after they were found to be hosting large parties under false pretenses, despite not being allowed to operate until July. After a brief spike in the number of new cases last week, the infection rate has returned to where it was in the month before the rise in cases. The Head of the Health Board Merike J¸rilo has resigned following numerous public disagreements with the governmentís Minister of Social Affairs and criticism of her handling of the response to the pandemic.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Estonia has experienced its largest single day increase of new COVID-19 cases since April 29, with 21 new cases diagnosed on June 5. The uptick in new cases has caused the governmentís Science Council to postpone its recommendations for further easing of restrictions for at least two weeks. The postponement comes even as the Council acknowledges that they were expecting an increase in cases due to the loosening of restrictions over the past few weeks. Foreign Minister Ursas Reinsalu has said that he has begun discussions with his Finnish counterpart to open their borders to tourists from their respective nations. Currently, Finns may travel to Estonia for tourism but Estonians cannot do the same in Finland. The government has extended its flight ban to high-risk European countries to June 21, while permitting travel to and from any European country whose infection rate in the past two weeks has been below 15 cases per 100,000 people.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A number of restrictions were lifted in Estonia this week as the country moves toward a new normal. Restaurants and bars are now permitted to return to normal operating hours, and public events of up to 100 people are now allowed. Residents of 20 European countries may now travel freely throughout Estonia without self-isolating first as their infection rate in the last two weeks has remained below 15 new infections per 100,000 people. Travellers must have spent at least the previous two weeks in one of the eligible countries in order to avoid quarantine measures. Citizens of other Schengen Area countries (and the United Kingdom) may travel to Estonia, but must undergo a two-week quarantine upon arrival. The Science Council has indicated that they may remove the mandatory social distancing order at some point this summer if infection rates continue to drop. However, the Head of the Health Boardís Emergency Medicine has said that the government expects Estonians to follow their recommendations even if they are not mandatory.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Minister of Education has said that the next academic year may start on August 15 - rather than September 1 - in an attempt to fill the gaps that may have arisen during remote learning. The government has discussed barring international students from registering in Estonian universities for the next year in an attempt to insulate from potential spread of the virus. However, universities have warned that this measure would cause them to lose millions of Euros in revenue. At least 10 Finns who crossed the border into Estonia on business in the past few weeks have since been diagnosed with COVID-19, prompting criticism from members of the governmentís own Scientific Council that the country has allowed quarantine-free business travel between the two countries.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The state of emergency in Estonia came to an end this week as most lockdown restrictions in the country were lifted, though some social distancing protocols remain. Most cultural and recreational institutions will reopen on June 1st, and the sale of alcohol after 10pm will also be permitted. A complete list of regulations for crossing the border were revealed for those from Baltic states and Finland, who need to provide a sufficient reason for entering Estonia. The governmentís controversial Emergency Act has provoked the ire of the President of Estonia, who publicly rebuked the governing party for fast-tracking the bill through parliament and not addressing the concerns of citizens. Critics have said that the bill gives too much power over emergency situations to state agencies, and reduces the role that the legislature plays in responding to crises. Despite these concerns, the government has stated that it is unlikely to amend the bill prior to the fall in the event of a second wave of infections.</p>
