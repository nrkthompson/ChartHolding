      Following the resignation last week of the Chief of the Health Board, the government has expressed hope of finding her replacement in the next few months--in anticipation of a second wave of the virus. Authorities in Estonia are concerned that Midsummer holiday festivities will lead to an uptick in cases, and police are monitoring certain events to ensure that guidelines are being followed. Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania were added to the list of countries where travellers need to self-isolate upon arrival in Estonia after their infection rates rose above 15 per 100,000 in the past two weeks. They join the UK, Sweden and Portugal. The Chair of the Estonian Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce said that the government has been indifferent to the plight of farmers who rely on seasonal foreign workers to harvest their crops. He added that initiatives to recruit locals have not worked, and only expanding eligibility to enter the country will alleviate the stress the industry is feeling.

      Estonia will lift its lockdown restrictions on nightclubs and bars on July 1. They will be limited to 50% capacity and a maximum of 100 people, and must adhere to disinfectant requirements. Additionally, the government announced that social distancing measures will become optional, effective immediately. In the interim, the Health Board has initiated criminal proceedings against the owners of multiple nightclubs in Tallinn after they were found to be hosting large parties under false pretenses, despite not being allowed to operate until July. After a brief spike in the number of new cases last week, the infection rate has returned to where it was in the month before the rise in cases. The Head of the Health Board Merike Jürilo has resigned following numerous public disagreements with the government’s Minister of Social Affairs and criticism of her handling of the response to the pandemic.

      Estonia has experienced its largest single day increase of new COVID-19 cases since April 29, with 21 new cases diagnosed on June 5. The uptick in new cases has caused the government’s Science Council to postpone its recommendations for further easing of restrictions for at least two weeks. The postponement comes even as the Council acknowledges that they were expecting an increase in cases due to the loosening of restrictions over the past few weeks. Foreign Minister Ursas Reinsalu has said that he has begun discussions with his Finnish counterpart to open their borders to tourists from their respective nations. Currently, Finns may travel to Estonia for tourism but Estonians cannot do the same in Finland. The government has extended its flight ban to high-risk European countries to June 21, while permitting travel to and from any European country whose infection rate in the past two weeks has been below 15 cases per 100,000 people.

      A number of restrictions were lifted in Estonia this week as the country moves toward a new normal. Restaurants and bars are now permitted to return to normal operating hours, and public events of up to 100 people are now allowed. Residents of 20 European countries may now travel freely throughout Estonia without self-isolating first as their infection rate in the last two weeks has remained below 15 new infections per 100,000 people. Travellers must have spent at least the previous two weeks in one of the eligible countries in order to avoid quarantine measures. Citizens of other Schengen Area countries (and the United Kingdom) may travel to Estonia, but must undergo a two-week quarantine upon arrival. The Science Council has indicated that they may remove the mandatory social distancing order at some point this summer if infection rates continue to drop. However, the Head of the Health Board’s Emergency Medicine has said that the government expects Estonians to follow their recommendations even if they are not mandatory.

      The Minister of Education has said that the next academic year may start on August 15 - rather than September 1 - in an attempt to fill the gaps that may have arisen during remote learning. The government has discussed barring international students from registering in Estonian universities for the next year in an attempt to insulate from potential spread of the virus. However, universities have warned that this measure would cause them to lose millions of Euros in revenue. At least 10 Finns who crossed the border into Estonia on business in the past few weeks have since been diagnosed with COVID-19, prompting criticism from members of the government’s own Scientific Council that the country has allowed quarantine-free business travel between the two countries.

      The state of emergency in Estonia came to an end this week as most lockdown restrictions in the country were lifted, though some social distancing protocols remain. Most cultural and recreational institutions will reopen on June 1st, and the sale of alcohol after 10pm will also be permitted. A complete list of regulations for crossing the border were revealed for those from Baltic states and Finland, who need to provide a sufficient reason for entering Estonia. The government’s controversial Emergency Act has provoked the ire of the President of Estonia, who publicly rebuked the governing party for fast-tracking the bill through parliament and not addressing the concerns of citizens. Critics have said that the bill gives too much power over emergency situations to state agencies, and reduces the role that the legislature plays in responding to crises. Despite these concerns, the government has stated that it is unlikely to amend the bill prior to the fall in the event of a second wave of infections.
