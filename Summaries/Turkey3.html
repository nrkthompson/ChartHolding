      With a drop in new cases as of May 29, Turkey declared the outbreak to be under control and  launched a process of “normalization,” effective June 1, under which almost all restrictions in the country were lifted, including restrictions on inter-city travel and domestic flights. However, citizens aged 65 and older and minors are still requested to stay home and require special permits to travel, since these groups are the most at-risk. Inter-city buses are allowed to operate at half capacity under COVID-19 measures. The national carrier Turkish Airlines (THY) launched the first domestic flight between Istanbul and Ankara with additional flights to other cities scheduled as of June 3. Passengers are required to receive a code from the Health Ministry which confirms their health condition before boarding flights. With the exception of  laptops, purses and baby strollers, all other hand baggage is banned on flights and masks are mandatory. Using thermal cameras, passengers are screened for body temperature at airport entrances. The ticket checking procedure will now be conducted automatically by devices installed at the airport. Hotels, beaches and historic sites in popular tourist destinations reopened with preventative measures. Restaurants and cafes fully reopened with the exception of bars, nightclubs and hookah lounges, which remain closed. Eatery staff are supposed to distribute kolonya and sanitizers to customers and check their body temperature and use of masks prior to admission. Tables must also be disinfected before new customers book the table. Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar, museums, gyms, sports facilities, child care centers and nurseries also reopened with strict health measures. Barbers, beauty salons, shopping malls and mosques now operate at full capacity.
