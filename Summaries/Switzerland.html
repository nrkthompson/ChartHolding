  <h5>February 8, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On February 5, Switzerland reported 1,765 new daily cases of COVID-19. The closure of non-essential stores, sports facilities, museums, libraries, and eateries has been extended until the end of February. The Swiss Teachers Association is demanding tests be extended to schools in the country but the Federal Council has rejected the idea due to each canton’s jurisdiction over education. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has not been approved for use in Switzerland due to insufficient data on safety, efficacy, and quality. However, the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are a part of the government's vaccination program. On February 6, “hundreds of protesters marched against coronavirus restrictions after the health minister said the current restrictions will stay in place through the end of February.”</p> 
  <h5>February 1, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On January 29, Switzerland reported 1,669 new cases of COVID-19 infection. Teleworking is mandatory and service providers and gas stations are subject to a 7 pm curfew. The closure of non-essential stores, sports facilities, museums, libraries, and eateries has been extended until the end of February. Effective February 8, people coming from high-risk countries will need to present a negative test prior to arriving in Switzerland, with exceptions for cross-border workers; the 10-day quarantine period will be shortened if, after 7 days, people test negative. The government plans to pay to test people who are asymptomatic as an incentive for people to get tested in nursing homes, schools, hotels, and large companies. The Federal Council aims to vaccinate six million people by the summer of 2021 and anyone over 75 or those with serious health conditions by the end of February.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On January 22, Switzerland reported 2,205 new daily cases of COVID-19 infection. Teleworking is mandatory and service providers and gas stations are subject to a 7 pm curfew. The closure of non-essential stores, sports facilities, museums, libraries, and eateries has been extended until the end of February. The rollout of Switzerland’s vaccination campaign has been slow due to difficulties related to its highly decentralized government structure.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On January 15, Switzerland reported 2,474 new daily cases of COVID-19 infection. The government announced new restrictions that will come into effect on January 18 and extended the current measures adopted on December 22 until the end of February. Effective January 18, non-essential shops must close and teleworking becomes mandatory. Service providers and gas stations are subject to a 7 pm curfew. Private demonstrations and gatherings are now limited to a maximum of 5 people, including children. The closure of sports facilities, museums, libraries, and eateries has been extended.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 18, 4,478 new daily cases of COVID-19 were reported in Switzerland. In the country, the level of COVID-19 infections and death remain persistently high. The current measures restricting the operating hours of restaurants, bars, and shops remain in effect until January 22. However, the Swiss national COVID-19 science taskforce has concluded that the new measures are insufficient. Many health experts fear a third COVID-19 wave following the skiing holidays in mid-January. Vaccinations in Switzerland will begin in January pending approval.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 11, 5,136 new daily cases of COVID-19 were reported in Switzerland. The rise in infections is much worse in the German-speaking cantons. New national measures will come into effect from December 12 to January 22 due to high levels of new infections. In most of the country, bars, restaurants, museums, libraries, leisure facilities, and shops must close by 7 pm. In French cantons, where infection rates are lower, cantons may extend the closing time to 11 pm -- if the reproduction rate is below 1 and the infection rate is below the national average for the week. Sports and cultural activities are permitted in groups of up to 5 people. Many cantons were resistant to the new measures introduced by the Federal Council.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 4, Switzerland reported 4,382 new daily cases of COVID-19. Swiss ski resorts will remain open -- putting the country on a Òcollision course with Italy, Germany, and France, who want to prevent their citizens from skiing abroad.Ó However, measures such as capacity restrictions or the early closing of eateries should be put in place in cantons to avoid large social gatherings. Beginning December 11, GraubŸnden will become the first Swiss canton to carry out voluntary mass testing. The pilot project will take place in three regions and aims to contain the spread and save the winter season in the cantonÕs tourism and ski regions.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past week, the COVID-19 situation in Switzerland has improved but hospitalizations and death rates remain high. The seven-day average of new positive cases is 3,902 -- 20% less than the previous week. The government announced that ski resorts can open as long as they comply with strict protection measures. COVID-19 vaccinations could begin in the first quarter of 2021 and will be free but not mandatory for all citizens.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Rates of infection, mortality, and hospitalization remain high in Switzerland. Several cantons, including Geneva, report some of the highest rates of infection in Europe. Some areas of Austria, Luxembourg, and Montenegro have been added to Switzerland's quarantine list. Across the country, ICU beds are near capacity.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Switzerland has become EuropeÕs top COVID-19 hot spot with a test positivity rate of 27.9%. COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths have doubled in Switzerland each week -- with hospitals projected to run out of ICU capacity by November 13. Several cantons have introduced their own measures that go beyond the federal framework, especially in the harder hit west and south of the country. Cantons may adopt additional measures, but are required to follow the federal policies. Western cantons, including Geneva, Bern, and Vaud, will receive military support to help relieve the burden on ambulance workers and provide basic care to patients at hospitals.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 7, there were 10,098 reported daily new infections in Switzerland. Several cantons have begun enforcing additional restrictions that go beyond those mandated by the Swiss Federal Council on October 28. Geneva is currently in a local lockdown and has closed bars, restaurants, non-essential shops, and leisure establishments. On November 2, rapid antigen tests were made available that provided results within 15 minutes.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 30, Switzerland reported 9,207 daily new cases of COVID-19. Switzerland imposed new national measures on October 29, which include the closure of nightclubs and an extension on mandatory mask rules. Masks are mandatory in public indoor and outdoor spaces, which includes workspaces, public transport, and busy pedestrian zones. Restaurants and cafes must close from 11:00 pm to 6:00 am and are only permitted to seat 4 people per table, with exceptions for families with small children. At higher education institutions, face to face teaching is no longer permitted. Private gatherings have been limited to 10 people and public events have been limited to 50 people, with exceptions for organized political gatherings. Travellers arriving from Belgium, Czech Republic, Andorra, Armenia, and several French regions are being considered high risk and must quarantine for 10 days upon arrival. The government is no longer limiting business and medical travel to 5 days. Other measures vary between regions since cantons have autonomy over health matters in Switzerland.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the weekend of October 24-25, Switzerland reported 17, 440 new infections.Unlike the summer months, cases are spread out across all age groups. The Swiss government does not plan to take over management of the pandemic, but imposed some national measures, including making masks mandatory in closed off public spaces and limiting private gatherings to 15 people. Some cantons have imposed new measures related to eateries, public gatherings, and leisure activities. However, measures vary between each of the 26 regions who each have autonomy over health.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 16, new daily cases doubled, rising to 3,105. On October 15, the government met with the 26 cantonal health directors to discuss new nationwide measures and decided to hold off on additional restrictions. On October 18, the government announced tighter restrictions, including the national obligation to wear masks in all indoor public spaces, including on public transport. In public places, gatherings of more than 15 people are now banned.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 12, Switzerland reported about 4,068 new cases of COVID-19 in a 72-hour period. Due to COVID-19, Geneva will introduce a guaranteed minimum wage to address poverty in the city. In Switzerland, wages can be regulated by local authorities in each canton and two other cantons have introduced similar measures to address city economies dependent on tourism.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective September 25, Switzerland has imposed quarantine requirements on arrivals from regions of France, the Liguria region in Italy, and Upper and Lower Austria. Beginning October 1, Òconcerts, football matches, conferences, and other large-scale public and private events of more than 1,000 people can resume.Ó Organizers require permission from local authorities whose decision will be made based on public health conditions and their tracing capacities. Masks must be worn, people must remain seated where possible, and ticket sales cannot exceed _ of the normal capacity. Despite a rising number of infections, and recommendations by the governmentÕs COVID-19 task force not to ease restrictions, Switzerland is one of the first to allow for the return of mass events.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Switzerland, cases are rising likely related to easing of lockdown measures and the resumption of international travel. Following a COVID-19 outbreak, 2,500 undergraduate students at a hospitality management school have been put into quarantine. Switzerland is taking a regional approach to the pandemic, allowing cantons to impose restrictions based on local conditions. On September 27, Swiss citizens voted against a freedom of movement proposal that would have ended the free movement of people into the country from the EU. The proposal would have also given preferential access to Swiss citizens for jobs and social benefits by limiting immigration.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Swiss universities reopened on September 14, with a mix of on-campus and online teaching for the fall semester. Effective September 14, regions bordering Switzerland will not be included on the Swiss list of high-risk countries due to social, cultural, and economic interactions. As a result, quarantine obligations for people travelling from these regions are no longer in place. Some cantons are concerned about this change and are worried it could lead to higher costs and reduced compliance with quarantine rules. The government added 9 of 13 French regions and Vienna, the capital of Austria, to its list of high-risk regions.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government extended the period allowed for placing employees on short-term unemployment from 12 to 18 months, to counteract a rise in unemployment. The Federal Office of Public Health updated its list of countries deemed high risk, removing Belgium, Mexico, and Luxembourg, while adding several others including, Croatia and Ukraine. Countries on this list are subject to a 10-day quarantine on arrival. On September 7, the National Council resumed in plexiglass in order to comply with social distancing requirements. These plexiglass dividers were installed to allow for Parliament to resume if a member tests positive, rather than requiring everyone to quarantine.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Restrictions on public gatherings and major events were extended until September 30. On August 18, Switzerland updated its list of high-risk countries, which now includes Albania, Belgium, Malta, India, and Spain. Croatia remains on Switzerland’s list of safe travel countries, despite the high number of infections. Most students in Switzerland have returned to school; two more cantons will resume classes soon. Despite a rising number of infections in Switzerland, masks are not compulsory for primary school students because--according to Swiss health authorities--children under 12 are not prone to COVID-19 infection.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 12, the Swiss Federal Council announced an extension to the current restrictions on public gatherings and major events until September 30. Effective October 1, events of more than 1,000 people may resume but strict measures will be in place, with each required authorization by cantons. This localized approach is aimed at taking into account the individual situations of each canton and their contact tracing capacity. Due to the limit on public gatherings and events, the 2020 Road World Championship set for September 20-27 has been cancelled.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Cases are quickly rising in Switzerland, causing concern that restrictions may need to be tightened to avoid a second wave of infections. However, on August 5, the Health Minister said new countrywide measures were unlikely. A senior advisor to the government has made several recommendations, such as compulsory mask wearing in all indoor spaces and a limit of 100 people at all events. Since August 1, passengers arriving from Israel, Serbia, and Turkey must undergo a COVID-19 test at the airport. Effective August 8, the list of 42 high risk countries will be expanded to 46 and will include mainland Spain and Romania. In Geneva, the canton has ordered the closure of all nightclubs and cabarets until August 23.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 23, people arriving in Switzerland from a list of 42 countries have to quarantine for 10 days. The Federal Office of Public Health has decided to add more countries to the risk list on the basis of new infections. A group of health experts would like Switzerland’s list extended to include nations that do little or no testing.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 20, Switzerland relaxed its entry restrictions for 21 countries, including Canada. The Swiss government has expanded its quarantine watchlist to 42 countries, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Luxembourg, Mexico, and Montenegro. Travellers from countries on the watchlist must enter a 10-day quarantine upon arrival in Switzerland. Public health authorities have removed Belarus and Sweden from this list.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since July 6, all travellers entering Switzerland from a list of 29 high-risk countries must self-isolate for 10 days or face a possible fine of 10,000 francs. Healthcare workers are exempt due to a staffing shortage in Swiss hospitals. On July 20, Switzerland will relax entry restrictions for 21 countries including Canada, New Zealand, South Korea, and Thailand. COVID-19 lockdown restrictions have increased in several cantons across the country. These measures include stricter controls at nightclubs and bars, and a mandatory mask requirement at all educational institutions. Stricter restrictions are in place on gatherings in a number of cantons despite the Federal Council permitting public and private gatherings of up to 1,000 people.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While the government has phased out most of its restrictive policy measures, the number of new cases has increased as the economy has started to reopen. As a result, the Swiss government has made face masks mandatory on all public transport, effective July 6, for all passengers over the age of 12. Switzerland’s COVID-19 Science Task Force is advising people to avoid indoor events, particularly nightclubs and bars, after a cluster of infections was linked to nightclubs in Zurich. Nightclubs are now required to record the identity card details and phone numbers of all patrons, and temperature checks are being recommended upon entry. Since the pandemic began, Switzerland’s federal government has allowed cantons to take a localized approach to containing the virus. As a result, a number of cantons are enacting compulsory mask-wearing policies in retail spaces and shops.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 6, the limit on public gatherings will be expanded to 1,000 people, with plans to reevaluate on August 31. Effective July 6, everyone over the age of 12 will be required to wear masks on Swiss public transport. Until now, it was recommended but compliance was poor. Those refusing to wear a mask will now be fined. Beginning July 6, travellers entering Switzerland from a list of 29 countries must self-isolate for 10 days. This list will be updated regularly and travellers entering from these countries must register with the Federal Office of Public Health. This list includes the US, Sweden, and Serbia. Quarantine requirements for people entering Switzerland from regions at high risk of the virus has changed in response to rising numbers of infections and demands from the cantons. While the government acknowledged the EU Council’s recommendation to lift external border restrictions to third-country residents on July 1, Switzerland will keep its current entry ban in place until July 20. Despite rising infection numbers, the borders with Italy, Germany, France, and Austria remain open.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective June 22, groups of up to 1,000 people are authorized to gather in Switzerland at rallies and events. Wearing a mask will become mandatory during large events, but the social distancing requirement of two metres has been reduced to 1.5 metres. Restaurant curfews are no longer in effect and patrons are no longer obligated to remain seated at a table. The Swiss government has dropped their recommendation to work from home and it is now up to employers to decide where their staff should be working from. Employers are obliged to ensure the necessary safety measures are in place. On June 25, SwissCovid was launched, a voluntary COVID-19 mobile tracing app to prevent a potential second wave as restrictions are relaxed. The government hopes the app will help stop the spread of the virus by allowing them to track infection chains. Originally set to release in May, the app was delayed because the government wanted to ensure it complied with data protection laws and were waiting on Google-Apple to finish their bluetooth interfaces for tracing. On June 29, long distance international trains will resume operation between Switzerland and Italy. Health experts are refusing to rule out a new spike of infections in the coming months as Switzerland risks outbreaks similar to those in Germany.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Switzerland reopened its borders, lifting the remaining travel restrictions for countries in the EU and Schengen zone. While no quarantine is necessary upon arrival, these entry rules and conditions are subject to change depending on epidemiological situations in the countries. Presently, no travellers can enter from Spain. No announcements have been made for countries not included, but further easing of border restrictions for incoming guests from outside these areas are expected on July 6 at the latest.  The Federal Office of Public Health stated that specific rules may apply for “certain groups of people or for certain types of journeys under specific conditions.” These conditions may include mandatory quarantines or proof of a negative test. On June 17, Switzerland’s COVID-19 reproduction rate (R0) rose above one, prompting concerns that the country is prematurely ending its lockdown. “The news [about their reproduction rate (R0) over one] contradicts official claims that the country is winning the battle against the spread of COVID-19” and could be a warning sign for a second wave of infections.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Switzerland, the state of emergency is set to officially end on June 19. Effective June 6, several restrictions were eased in the country. Camping sites, pools, and leisure facilities have reopened and summer camps can resume with a maximum of 300 children,  as long as attendance is kept. Middle schools, vocational schools, and universities have reopened and all sports can resume except those that are high contact. The Swiss soccer Super League can resume with groups of up to 1,000 people allowed at sporting events beginning in July. In eateries, groups larger than 4 will be able to sit together, but will be required to register each attendee upon arrival. 2 metres distance between each table remains mandatory. Nightclubs will reopen, but establishments must adhere to distancing and hygiene rules which include a 300 person maximum, 2 metre distancing between patrons and a midnight curfew. Public gatherings of up to 300 people are permitted as long as a 2 metre distance is maintained. Demonstrators will need to apply for a permit and explain how they plan to minimize the spread. On June 15, Swiss borders will reopen to Germany, Austria, and France. On July 6, Switzerland plans to reopen borders with other Schengen zone countries. The National Council approved a Bluetooth contact tracing app aimed at preventing a potential second wave of infections. The app will be optional and no personal data or location information will be collected.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">June 1 signified the return to some political normalcy with federal initiatives and referendum requests resuming. Collecting signatures in public spaces will also now be permitted, given that protective measures are enforced. Effective June 6, several restrictions will be eased across the country. Public gatherings of 30 people and events of no more than 300 people will be permitted. Zoos, gardens, nightclubs, pools, campgrounds, theatres and cinemas will reopen. Swiss politicians decided that sex work can resume, but are facing criticism due to the continued ban on sports and activities that involve close physical contact. The Swiss ruling contrasts policy decisions in the Netherlands to keep the sex service sector closed until September. In the coming weeks, Swiss borders will reopen with Germany, Austria and France, but will maintain closed borders with Italy.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite a decline in the daily average of new COVID-19 cases, Swiss experts predict a second wave of infections. Experts have said that contact tracing is the most effective strategy for breaking transmission and controlling the spread. In mid-June, MPs will debate the use of Apple and Google’s contract tracing application before it is offered to the general public. As of May 30, public gatherings of 30 people will be permitted again, up from a previous limit of 5, followed by public and private events up to 300 people on June 6. The government will decide whether or not to lift a ban on events up to 1,000 people at the end of June. Also, summer camps, zoos, cinemas, theatres, and leisure facilities will reopen on June 8. In efforts to free up travel within the Schengen zone, the Swiss government plans to restore free movement with other  member countries by July 6. After reaffirming its plans with Germany, Austria, and France to lift all travel restrictions on June 15, Switzerland is advising citizens to avoid Italy until further steps can be coordinated in the coming weeks. Travel into Switzerland from outside the Schengen zone may not be possible until mid-July. The COVID-19 crisis has led to increased unity in Swiss Parliament over the need to re-industrialize the economy. Politicians from across the political spectrum are agreeing that substantial changes need to be made to avoid relying on other countries and international supply chains.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Switzerland’s defence department has been tasked with securing enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to treat its population. The country’s strategy continues to emphasize reducing new infection rates, testing symptomatic people, and contact tracing. Switzerland has remained cautious about the value of antibody testing, and has not yet bought any tests. On May 15Switzerland became the first country in Europe to end hospitality related restrictions. Despite being reopened, new measures have been implemented, which include menus being made available on an iPad that can be wiped clean, hand disinfectant stations, and distancing measures between tables. On May 20th, the Federal Council declared it would allow religious services to resume on May 28. While the Federal Office of Public Health has released a protection framework, religious communities are being given a week to come up with their own protection plans. Beginning June 15th, Germany, France, and Austria will open their borders with Switzerland provided that infections remain under control.</p>
