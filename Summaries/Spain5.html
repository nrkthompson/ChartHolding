      Schools in Spain remain closed, but some schools are testing new norms for the fall in voluntary classes. The tests include checking for masks and fevers at the gate, increased hand washing, disinfecting chairs and desks, and social distancing with and without masks. By June 15, 70% of Spain entered phase 3. Spain’s new normality is expected to begin June 21, although Galicia has already entered the new normality. Some sanitary measures implemented early in the outbreak remain. As of June 21, tourism will reopen to European and Schengen travellers, who must be nationals of the countries they arrive from, with the exception of Portugal whose travellers are not permitted until July. Tourists will only be permitted to visit parts of Spain in phase 3 and with infection rates of less than nine per 100,000 people. These tourists will not have to quarantine, but must stay for minimum five days and prove their return trip. Other regions will still require a 14 day quarantine. The remainder of Spain is anticipated to reopen tourism in July as lockdown eases. Andalucia wants to create a health passport for foreigners, both for tourists and immigrants, and to collect health tests and PCR test results from tourists and visitors. Federally and in Valencia and the Canary Islands, there are concerns about people entering the country through irregular immigration and enforcing testing and isolation in those cases.
