      On June 1, primary schools and kindergartens, open-air cinemas, year-round hotels and pools reopened. The decision to send younger students back to school faced criticism from parents, despite the number of confirmed cases declining to 49 this week. Campsites, wedding receptions, and tattoo parlours also reopened. The Greek government outlined a two-part plan for tourism. On June 15, visitors can fly into Athens and Thessaloniki, the two major airports. On July 1, direct international flights to regional airports, including on islands will be permitted. An initial decision that was made would only allow citizens from 29 countries to enter Greece, but this triggered some international backlash, including from the UK and Italy who had not been included on the permitted travel nationalities list. The government has since clarified that the measures refer to flights originating from specific airports, rather than countries, and are based on the EASA list of airports with high risks of transmission. Tourists arriving from airports listed on the EASA will be tested and remain at a designated hotel for one day. If the test is negative, visitors are then obliged to observe a 7 day quarantine and if positive, remain at the hotel for health monitoring and a 14 day quarantine. Authorities will conduct random sample testing on passengers arriving from airports on the approved list and not on the EASA list of airports with high risks of transmission.
