      Despite failing to demonstrate any sustained decrease in daily COVID-19 infections, the Polish government has continued to ease lockdown restrictions. Post-secondary institutions were allowed to resume classes on May 18th, while primary schools were allowed to resume classes for grades 1-3 on May 25th. Poland’s Ministry of the Interior and Administration has also begun easing restrictions at Poland’s border. Since May 23rd, students of Polish schools have been allowed to enter the country, while EU citizens and professional drivers performing international transport are being allowed to pass through Poland. After rejecting a bill that would have allowed Presidential elections to take place on May 10th using an untested correspondence voting system, Poland’s Senate has continued debating a revised bill proposed by the Polish Sejm, which would allow elections to take place using a combination of polling stations and correspondence voting before the end of President Andrzej Duda’s term on August 6th.
