      Tourism season officially began in Greece on June 15 with seasonal hotels, museums, historic buildings, and entertainment parks opening to visitors. Also, international flights will resume to Athens and Thessaloniki airports. Travellers arriving from airports deemed high risk by the EASA will be tested upon arrival and could face quarantines, however, for other travellers there are no requirements and they may only be subject to random testing. Direct flights between international destinations and the islands will not resume until July 1, along with direct flights between the US and Greece. The government is implementing several measures which include testing facilities on the islands, designated doctors for each hotel and quarantine zones for those who test positive. An increase in the number of cases among several municipalities has led authorities to impose a curfew and restrictions on gatherings and  travel.  Since Greece has opened its doors to international visitors, resurgence is a concern and authorities are implementing strict measures to avoid outbreaks in cities or tourist areas where there may be crowds. The prime minister said Greece will be prepared in the event of a second wave because of social distancing, protective measures and additional ICU hospital beds.

      The Greek Health Ministry has announced 97 new cases since June 5, during which they experienced the largest daily increase since April 23, with 52 new cases in 24 hours. In response, on June 9 the government announced they would increase testing and ensure compliance with protection measures as well as introduce restrictions locally where clusters of new infections have been reported over the past few days. Of the 97 new cases, 30 involved travellers from abroad. June 15 marks the beginning of the tourist season with flights to the Athens and Thessaloniki airports set to resume. Arrivals from EASA airports will be subject to testing and quarantine. On July 1, flights to all Greek airports and sea arrivals from all countries will resume. Tourists will be subject to random testing. Regardless of Greece's plan to maintain strict hygiene protocols in hotels and businesses, it is uncertain how many airlines will be flying to the country or if people are willing to partake in non-essential travel.

      On June 1, primary schools and kindergartens, open-air cinemas, year-round hotels and pools reopened. The decision to send younger students back to school faced criticism from parents, despite the number of confirmed cases declining to 49 this week. Campsites, wedding receptions, and tattoo parlours also reopened. The Greek government outlined a two-part plan for tourism. On June 15, visitors can fly into Athens and Thessaloniki, the two major airports. On July 1, direct international flights to regional airports, including on islands will be permitted. An initial decision that was made would only allow citizens from 29 countries to enter Greece, but this triggered some international backlash, including from the UK and Italy who had not been included on the permitted travel nationalities list. The government has since clarified that the measures refer to flights originating from specific airports, rather than countries, and are based on the EASA list of airports with high risks of transmission. Tourists arriving from airports listed on the EASA will be tested and remain at a designated hotel for one day. If the test is negative, visitors are then obliged to observe a 7 day quarantine and if positive, remain at the hotel for health monitoring and a 14 day quarantine. Authorities will conduct random sample testing on passengers arriving from airports on the approved list and not on the EASA list of airports with high risks of transmission.

On June 1, year-round hotels will reopen with seasonal hotels to follow on June 15, the same day some direct international flights from Athens International Airport will resume. However, many direct international flights will not resume until July 1. Greece will allow between 20-25 countries to visit without quarantine. Currently, citizens from all EU countries except Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands can fly into Athens but are subject to a 14 day quarantine. Visits from Britain and other non-EU countries are currently restricted, including Canada and the United States.

      Greece entered the third phase of their reopening plan on May 18, reopening malls, some schools, archeological sites, and beaches. Primary schools and kindergartens remain closed, but middle schools and high schools will operate by dividing classes into two groups and alternating the groups on different days. Other measures include having a maximum of 15 students per classroom, optional face masks, and the cleaning and disinfection of school facilities twice a day. Online learning will be provided for students who are unable to attend classes and for the days students are not in school. Greeceâ€™s tourism sector is set to begin reopening by June 15, starting with the reopening of seasonal hotels. Greece reopened 500 public beaches under strict physical distancing measures that include guidelines for the number of beachgoers and distances between beach umbrellas and sunbeds. A mandatory 14 day quarantine for incoming visitors and returning residents has been extended until the end of May. Free travel between regions on the mainland and to the island of Crete will resume, and sea travel will be allowed with boats filled to 50% capacity. While airports are reopening to international traffic later this month, it is unclear when direct flights to the main tourist islands will resume. The government has announced their plan to offer sample tests to incoming tourists but, not whether these will be available to all.
