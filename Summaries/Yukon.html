  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The total number of cases in Yukon has continued to increase slowly over the past week. The territory had 12 active cases as of December 4. Due to fears of possible community transmission, the government is now testing some individuals even if they are asymptomatic. Starting December 7, restaurants and bars are required to maintain a daily list of patrons to assist with contact tracing. The records will be kept for 30 days. Masks became mandatory in all indoor public spaces on December 1. The gathering limit of 10 people indoors and 50 outdoors remains unchanged.</p>

  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No active cases remain in Yukon. The state of emergency has been extended again -- without a definite duration.

It is also recommended that equipment and change rooms be disinfected after each use and that players come dressed in full gear when possible.</p>

The majority of students have physically returned to school on August 20. Masks are not mandatory, but recommended for students age 10 and older in situations where distancing is not possible.

As of September 1, YukonU campuses across the territory will be open to students and employees; however, access will be restricted and campuses will remain closed to the general public.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No active cases remain in Yukon.

  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Yukon is moving into Phase 3 of its reopening plan on August 1 as scheduled. Phase 3 is described as ìless prescriptiveî about maintaining a two-household bubble and more about keeping social circles small and following hygiene practices. Limits on household gatherings will remain at 10 people, although officials are working on guidelines for indoor seated and planned events that would allow events like weddings, funerals or sewing circles. Green decals have been handed out since July 20 to vehicles with out-of-territory licence plates whose occupants are allowed to be travelling within the territory. More detailed guidelines have been released for how schools should operate amid the pandemic. The guidelines emphasize physical distancing whenever possible, as well as enhanced cleaning protocols and procedures if students get symptoms. Recommendations on school busing were also provided to prevent unnecessary mixing of students. Finalized plans are expected to be released by August 12. A protest criticizing the high school reopening plan in Whitehorse was held on July 20. Protesters argued that it was important for students to be in full-time classes in their final years of school and to have full access to services offered through the education system.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>

Older students in Whitehorse will only attend half-days at school. The other half of each school day for these students will involve studying at home or somewhere else outside of the classroom.
