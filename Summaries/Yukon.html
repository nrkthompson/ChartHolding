  <p style="text-align:justify;">No active cases remain in Yukon. The Yukon border will reopen on July 1 to residents of the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and B.C. travelling directly from those jurisdictions--without the need to self-isolate. Other Canadians can also enter Yukon if they self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving. Wearing masks or a face covering will be required when entering the airport. Yukon entered Phase 2 of its reopening plan on July 1 and was expected to remain in this phase for 2 to 4 weeks. Outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people are now permitted. Restaurants and bars can operate at full capacity if following physical distancing. Personal services can reopen. Some public libraries are reintroducing services in a limited capacity. Farmers markets are allowed to host non-food vendors. Public pools must submit an operational plan and receive approval before opening to the public.</p>
