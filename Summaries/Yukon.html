  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No active cases remain in Yukon. The government is expanding testing criteria to anyone with COVID-19 symptoms. However, no additional tests have been performed on travellers entering the territory. The Whitehorse Public Library will reopen to the public on July 21, with limited computer access and reduced seating. Many government employees have been returning to their offices. A universal early learning program is being worked on that would be available on a sliding scale income model similar to what is offered in Quebec. Yukon is poised to enter Phase 3 of its reopening plan on August 1. While limited details about the next phase have been released, it will stay in place until a vaccine is available.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No active cases remain in Yukon. The border is open to residents of the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and B.C. as long as they travel directly from those jurisdictions, without the need to self-isolate. Yukon is still at Phase 2 of its reopening plan. The territory could enter Phase 3, which has been dubbed the “new normal,” as early as August. Details of Phase 3 will be released in two weeks. Outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people are now permitted. Restaurants and bars can operate at full capacity if they follow social distancing regulations. The plan for the 2020-2021 school year has been announced. Under the new plan, all students from kindergarten to grade 9 and the students in grades 10 to 12 outside of Whitehorse will receive full days of in-class instruction, five days a week. Older students in Whitehorse will only attend half-days at school. The other half of each school day for these students will involve studying at home or somewhere else outside of the classroom. The arrangement would be monitored during the first semester to guide plans for the second semester.</p>
