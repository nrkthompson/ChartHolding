Starting July 1, residents from British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut can enter without self-isolation. The territory is moving to phase 2 of its reopening plan on July 1. Outdoor gatherings can occur with 50 people, while a maximum of 10 people can gather indoors. Restaurants will be operating at full capacity, but bars have to wait for further guidance. Farmers markets will be able to welcome non-food vendors. Pools will reopen. Full dental services will resume. Personal service establishments such as hair salons, tattoo parlours and massage therapists are currently permitted to operate. Overnight camping will be allowed following public health guidance. In-person classes at all K-12 public schools have been suspended for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.</p>
