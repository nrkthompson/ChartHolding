      On June 5, the government announced their plan to fast-track its reopening strategy by reducing the number of phases to four, from the  initially scheduled five-phase plan. As  Ireland entered the second phase of its reopening strategy on June 8, a number of restrictions were lifted, including an allowance of up to six people to visit a household and meet outdoors for a short period of time, while maintaining strict social distancing rules. All high street shops resumed their businesses, while enforcing social distancing rules and staggered opening times to avoid unnecessary crowds. However all units in the shopping malls are to reopen next week with a restriction on gathering around benches or fountains. Libraries also began a phased reopening along with marts without spectators. Travelling of up to 20km away from home is allowed with the maintenance of social distancing measures and other guidelines in place.Gatherings at funerals and weddings of up to 25 people are extended from the previous set limit of 10. Groups of up to 15 people will be able to meet for outdoor sporting activities, with playgrounds fully reopening for kids. Creches, pre-schools, hotels, restaurants and bars which provide table service, are scheduled to reopen within phase three of the relaxation strategy, effective June 29.
