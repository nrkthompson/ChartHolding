  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 23, the government announced its decision to postpone easing some restrictions following a public backlash to the government’s briefing on entering Phase 4 of the deconfinement strategy. The plan for Phase 4 of reopening had proposed relaxing the 14-day self-isolation requirement for travellers from eastern and southern Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, along with an increase in the limit on public gatherings — to 75 people from 50 indoors, and to 250 from 100 outdoors.  Both of these proposed changes are off the table for now. However, effective July 25, cinemas, casinos and movie theatres reopened and stage performances resumed, as planned under Phase 4 — but at 30% capacity instead of the initially planned 50%. The same limits also apply for faith-based gatherings. The easing of restrictions on walk-up counter service in bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, microbreweries and distilleries has been put on hold for now. Changes to visits at long-term and personal care homes also came into effect; each resident is now allowed to identify two support people who can visit them in their own rooms. Retail businesses and indoor recreation sites are able to use non-permeable barriers where two metre physical distancing is not possible. Although the province has backed off some of its immediate plans to loosen restrictions, the public health officer has warned people to maintain practices like handwashing, mask wearing and physical distancing to protect vulnerable people and reduce strain on the health-care system.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government announced an extension to its province-wide state of emergency, effective 15 July, for 30 days. It was first declared on March 20 and was further extended on April 18, May 17 and June 15. Provincial public health officials announced plans for further loosening outdoor gathering restrictions in the coming weeks but hosting large sporting events with an audience this fall will most likely be difficult.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba entered Phase 3 of its returning safe services plan on June 21, with many health order restrictions eased. However, restrictions on capacities for religious services, clubs and other indoor gatherings still remain in place. Although no new cases have been discovered since the reopening of Manitoba, the provincial chief public health officer is considering the idea of further action on health orders in the coming weeks, possibly including mandatory face masks by fall.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since Manitoba entered phase three of reopening on June 21, no new COVID-19 cases have been discovered as of July 4--with the exception of an individual who was tested positive on June 29 after flying from Winnipeg to Vancouver on June 19. Individuals in the affected rows of the airplane were advised to self-isolate for 14 days and monitor for symptoms. If symptoms develop, people are requested to self-isolate and get tested.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba entered phase 3 of reopening on June 21 with several restrictions easing throughout the province. Indoor gatherings of up to 50 people and outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people are allowed with physical distancing. These limits can be expanded if attendees split into separate groups that don't intermingle. If a group activity at a seniors centre is necessary, organizers are advised to consider limiting capacity to 25 people indoors, or one person per 10 square meters. Moreover, the 14-day self-isolation requirement is lifted for people coming into Manitoba on their way to cabins or tourist destinations from approximately six Canadian provinces and territories and with other exemptions. Retail businesses, restaurants and bars reopened at full capacity with distancing and without dance floors. Indoor recreation centres are allowed to operate at 50% capacity with social distancing and sanitation measures. Permanent outdoor amusement parks reopened at 50% capacity. Casinos and movie theatres have not yet reopened. Child-care centres reopened at normal capacity, but the maximum number of children in day camp groups is 50 students. Overnight camps, choirs, band camps and musical theatre are prohibited. Post-secondary schools intend to reopen by fall with restrictions. All health-care and therapeutic businesses, regulated or non-regulated, returned to normal occupancy with physical distancing.</p>
