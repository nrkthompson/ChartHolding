  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 27, Manitoba announced 344 new cases of COVID-19 and 14 more COVID-19 related deaths. Ahead of Black Friday, the government issued to reminder to Manitobans of the restrictions in place; fines for violating the restrictions range from $1,296 for individuals to $5,000 for businesses. The government has also urged Manitobans not to leave the province to shop in places where the restrictions are not as stringent.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 20, Manitoba recorded 438 new cases of COVID-19. The Manitoba government announced enhanced public health restrictions on November 19, which will remain in effect until December 1. Under these new measures, the province further limited social contacts, only allowing those within a household to enter a private residence. Exceptions to this rule can be made for essential reasons such as childcare, homecare services, tutoring, construction, repairs, and emergency response. Existing orders limiting public gatherings outside the home to five people remain in effect to allow for events, such as weddings, funerals, and baptisms to take place.Businesses that sell essential items such as food, medication, office supplies and major appliances will be required to remove any non-essential goods from the shelves or rope off those areas. Large retailers are required to restrict their capacity to 25% of normal capacity, or to a maximum of 250, whichever is lower.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of November 13, Manitoba surpassed more than 10,000 cases of COVID-19. The province entered code red restrictions on November 12, restricting travel to and from northern Manitoba, with non-essential travel discouraged. Retail businesses listed as critical services are allowed to remain open at 25% capacity, with non-critical services only able to provide e-service, curbside pickup, and delivery. All personal services businesses, fitness centres, sport facilities, museums, casinos, galleries, libraries, movie theatres, and concert halls are closed. In-person dining at restaurants is prohibited but delivery and takeaway services are permitted. Group gatherings restricted to less than five people. No changes have been made to childcare services, kindergarten, primary, or secondary education. Therapeutic care services that are self-regulated, including massage therapists, can also continue to provide services. These measures will stay in effect for four weeks.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 5, Manitoba recorded 427 new daily cases of COVID-19, with more deaths linked to outbreaks at Winnipeg hospitals and new outbreaks declared in personal care homes. The government is not considering a curfew in the Winnipeg area. Health officials said that this measure would be premature right now -- given that Winnipeg and the surrounding area are only a few days into the latest heightened public health restrictions. The province plans to increase enforcement, including improvements to its tip line for reporting COVID-19 rule breakers.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 30, Manitoba announced 480 new cases of COVID-19, which has been the highest number recorded since the reopening of the province. Effective November 2, the province went into Code Orange, and Winnipeg moved to Code Red, or critical level. In Code Red, all elective, non-urgent, and diagnostic surgeries will be suspended. Movie theatres, concert halls, sports facilities, restaurants and bar dining rooms will close down, with restaurants only allowed to offer takeout and delivery services. Visitation at hospitals will be suspended, with case-by-case exceptions for patients receiving end-of-life care, in labour, and pediatric patients. Retail stores in the region would be required to limit capacity to 25% or five people, whichever is lower. No changes will be made to schools in the Winnipeg area. Across Manitoba, the orange-level restrictions will reduce capacity at restaurants, bars, retail stores, museums, galleries and libraries to 50%. These new measures will be in place for at least two weeks.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 25, 161 new cases were identified, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Manitoba to 4,249. Effective October 26, new rules were implemented for schools in the Winnipeg area and northern Manitoba, as the province's COVID-19 case count continues to rise. Under the new restrictions, schools are required to keep students 2 meters apart "to the greatest extent possible." Kindergarten to grade 8 students also have the option of temporary remote learning while schools remain in the restricted orange level of the province's pandemic response system.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 18, the current five-day COVID-19 test positivity rate is 4.7%. 44 new cases have been recorded ahead of new restrictions in the province, which will be in effect for two weeks starting October 19. Casinos, bars, and bingo halls will be closed, but restaurants and lounges will remain open at 50% capacity as long as no more than five people can sit at a given table. The province has further restricted public gatherings, from 10 to 5. Retail stores, galleries, museums, and libraries will also have capacity reduced to 50%, while spectator areas at sporting events will be cut to 25%. The chief provincial public health officer has also strongly encouraged Manitobans to reduce the number of close contacts outside their household and avoid closed-in or crowded spaces.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Manitoba government announced 97 new cases of COVID-19 in the province on October 10, setting a new single-day record. The province is warning Manitobans about possible exposure at a school in Brandon, identified on October 2, and is urging the public to be cautious while visiting seniors, after outbreaks were declared at multiple personal care homes. With cases on the rise in Manitoba, the province introduced additional restrictions which came into effect this week. Under the new public health orders licensed bars and restaurants are no longer allowed to sell or serve alcohol past 10 pm, and all customers must leave by 11 pm.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Members of a Manitoba First Nation went into lockdown after several people tested positive for COVID-19, possible due, according to provincial health officials, several people from the community attending events at a recreation centre from September 24-27. People in the community are being told to leave their homes only to seek testing, for medical care, or to send one person from a household for essential supplies; travelling to Winnipeg from the affected area has also been banned.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective September 28, Winnipeg and 17 nearby areas will be moved to orange, or ‘restricted’ level, on the pandemic response scale -- following a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases. The new rules will be in place for at least four weeks: two incubation periods for the virus. Under the new level, masks will be mandatory in all indoor public places including bars and restaurants -- except while actually seated at a table to eat or drink. The mandatory mask rule will also apply to people who work with the public, but not to those in other workplaces. Public gatherings will be restricted to a maximum of 10 people, indoors and outdoors, which includes gatherings like weddings and funerals. New gathering sizes will not apply to places already under specific rules through current public health orders, including schools, restaurants, child-care facilities, retail stores, museums, theatres and casinos. A small number of faith-based organizations that previously opted for cohorting will need to switch over to observing capacity limits. The rules for organized sporting events will not change.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 21, Manitoba has 29 new COVID-19 cases -- with possible transmission occurring  on public transport and at restaurants. The health minister has warned Manitobans to comply with the safety measures in place in order to avoid the reinstitution of restrictions. On September 17, following a rise in COVID-19 cases in schools, the head of the union representing Manitoba teachers requested that the provincial government do more to reduce class sizes.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Students returned back to school on September 8 in Manitoba. The return to school is mandatory, although remote learning options are available for students who are immunocompromised. Parents who do not wish to send their children back to school must notify the province and home-school them instead.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba unveiled a new colour-coded system on August 19  that will allow the government to roll out COVID-19 restrictions targeting specific regions, communities or industries in the province. The new system has four risk levels, each triggering possible measures that public health officials can take to limit the spread of the virus. Similar to the existing forest-fire risk system, the pandemic response tool uses the colours green, yellow, orange and red. At each level, public health officials have a range of restrictions that could be imposed on different sectors, such as schools, restaurants, child-care centres and community gatherings As risk levels rise in a community or region, the province could tighten restrictions, such as reducing the size of gatherings or restricting travel in and out of an area. Manitoba as a whole is currently under the yellow "caution" risk level, meaning community transmission of COVID-19 is considered to be at low levels. The yellow level includes many restrictions Manitobans are already familiar with, such as limits on gathering sizes, restrictions on people returning from out of province, and directions to practise good hygiene and physical distancing. However, following the rise in COVID-19 cases in the southwestern region of Manitoba, gathering sizes will be restricted to 10 and face masks will be mandatory in public places within the Prairie Mountain Health region effective August 24. More clusters of infection, a higher test positivity rate and a number of large potential exposures at beaches and parks in the region led to the decision to raise the region's response level to orange.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 13, the government announced new measures for school reopening in the fall. On school buses, drivers and students in Grade 5 and up will be required to wear non-medical masks. Masks are strongly recommended--but not mandatory--for students from grades 5 to 12 in common areas and in spaces where physical distancing isn't possible.  If a COVID-19 case is detected at a school, closures will be considered as a last resort--and only if there is evidence of transmission among multiple groups of students or staff. Extra handwashing and sanitation stations will be set up and schools will need to clean commonly touched surfaces (like door handles), washrooms, and lunchrooms at least twice daily. Water fountains that are not touchless will be turned off. Staff will serve all food in cafeterias, and no shared containers will be allowed in lunchrooms. Schools are also asked to take ventilation into account in their back-to-school plans by avoiding air recirculation and by making sure air filters are clean.  Schools will need to schedule classes to avoid giving students spare periods, to limit bathroom occupancy at any given time, and to make sure students stay in smaller cohorts when two-metre distancing isn't possible. Parents who are uncomfortable sending their kids to school can homeschool them, but they won't be allowed to just keep them at home.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 7, new cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Manitoba, with most of them linked to a cluster in Brandon or to the close contacts of known COVID cases. The new cases include several young people, including some as young as 10. Manitobaís Premier warned Manitobans to follow health measures and orders to help stop the spread of COVID-19, but did not mention the possibility of mandatory face masks.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 30, the government of Manitoba announced its plan to reopen schools in fall.  There will be full time learning in classrooms for all students from kindergarten to Grade 8; high school students may have some remote learning--depending on whether schools can ensure physical distancing. COVID-19 prevention efforts are to be measured in levels, so the return to classes will begin at Level 1 in September, but this may be scaled up depending on COVID-19 cases in the province. Level 1 involves enforcing two metres of physical distancing between students to the greatest extent possible. When this is not possible, students will be organized into cohorts and space will be arranged to encourage separation, including the use of larger areas like multipurpose rooms. Schools will also need to limit gatherings in common areas such as lunchrooms and will be encouraged to use outdoor venues as much as possible. Lunches and recesses will be staggered and teachers will move between classrooms, instead of students, to limit the number of people gathering in hallways and schoolyards. Assemblies and gatherings that exceed whatever the current public health guidelines are at that time will not be permitted. Sports and gym classes can continue as long as they meet physical distancing requirements.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 23, the government announced its decision to postpone easing some restrictions following a public backlash to the governmentís briefing on entering Phase 4 of the deconfinement strategy. The plan for Phase 4 of reopening had proposed relaxing the 14-day self-isolation requirement for travellers from eastern and southern Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, along with an increase in the limit on public gatherings ó to 75 people from 50 indoors, and to 250 from 100 outdoors.  Both of these proposed changes are off the table for now. However, effective July 25, cinemas, casinos and movie theatres reopened and stage performances resumed, as planned under Phase 4 ó but at 30% capacity instead of the initially planned 50%. The same limits also apply for faith-based gatherings. The easing of restrictions on walk-up counter service in bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, microbreweries and distilleries has been put on hold for now. Changes to visits at long-term and personal care homes also came into effect; each resident is now allowed to identify two support people who can visit them in their own rooms. Retail businesses and indoor recreation sites are able to use non-permeable barriers where two metre physical distancing is not possible. Although the province has backed off some of its immediate plans to loosen restrictions, the public health officer has warned people to maintain practices like handwashing, mask wearing and physical distancing to protect vulnerable people and reduce strain on the health-care system.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government announced an extension to its province-wide state of emergency, effective 15 July, for 30 days. It was first declared on March 20 and was further extended on April 18, May 17 and June 15. Provincial public health officials announced plans for further loosening outdoor gathering restrictions in the coming weeks but hosting large sporting events with an audience this fall will most likely be difficult.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba entered Phase 3 of its returning safe services plan on June 21, with many health order restrictions eased. However, restrictions on capacities for religious services, clubs and other indoor gatherings still remain in place. Although no new cases have been discovered since the reopening of Manitoba, the provincial chief public health officer is considering the idea of further action on health orders in the coming weeks, possibly including mandatory face masks by fall.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since Manitoba entered phase three of reopening on June 21, no new COVID-19 cases have been discovered as of July 4--with the exception of an individual who was tested positive on June 29 after flying from Winnipeg to Vancouver on June 19. Individuals in the affected rows of the airplane were advised to self-isolate for 14 days and monitor for symptoms. If symptoms develop, people are requested to self-isolate and get tested.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba entered phase 3 of reopening on June 21 with several restrictions easing throughout the province. Indoor gatherings of up to 50 people and outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people are allowed with physical distancing. These limits can be expanded if attendees split into separate groups that don't intermingle. If a group activity at a seniors centre is necessary, organizers are advised to consider limiting capacity to 25 people indoors, or one person per 10 square meters. Moreover, the 14-day self-isolation requirement is lifted for people coming into Manitoba on their way to cabins or tourist destinations from approximately six Canadian provinces and territories and with other exemptions. Retail businesses, restaurants and bars reopened at full capacity with distancing and without dance floors. Indoor recreation centres are allowed to operate at 50% capacity with social distancing and sanitation measures. Permanent outdoor amusement parks reopened at 50% capacity. Casinos and movie theatres have not yet reopened. Child-care centres reopened at normal capacity, but the maximum number of children in day camp groups is 50 students. Overnight camps, choirs, band camps and musical theatre are prohibited. Post-secondary schools intend to reopen by fall with restrictions. All health-care and therapeutic businesses, regulated or non-regulated, returned to normal occupancy with physical distancing.</p>
