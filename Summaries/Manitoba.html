      Manitoba entered phase 3 of reopening on June 21 with several restrictions easing throughout the province. Indoor gatherings of up to 50 people and outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people are allowed with physical distancing. These limits can be expanded if attendees split into separate groups that don't intermingle. If a group activity at a seniors centre is necessary, organizers are advised to consider limiting capacity to 25 people indoors, or one person per 10 square meters. Moreover, the 14-day self-isolation requirement is lifted for people coming into Manitoba on their way to cabins or tourist destinations from approximately six Canadian provinces and territories and with other exemptions. Retail businesses, restaurants and bars reopened at full capacity with distancing and without dance floors. Indoor recreation centres are allowed to operate at 50% capacity with social distancing and sanitation measures. Permanent outdoor amusement parks reopened at 50% capacity. Casinos and movie theatres have not yet reopened. Child-care centres reopened at normal capacity, but the maximum number of children in day camp groups is 50 students. Overnight camps, choirs, band camps and musical theatre are prohibited. Post-secondary schools intend to reopen by fall with restrictions. All health-care and therapeutic businesses, regulated or non-regulated, returned to normal occupancy with physical distancing.
