  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba entered Phase 3 of its returning safe services plan on June 21, with many health order restrictions eased. However, restrictions on capacities for religious services, clubs and other indoor gatherings still remain in place. Although no new cases have been discovered since the reopening of Manitoba, the provincial chief public health officer is considering the idea of further action on health orders in the coming weeks, possibly including mandatory face masks by fall.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since Manitoba entered phase three of reopening on June 21, no new COVID-19 cases have been discovered as of July 4--with the exception of an individual who was tested positive on June 29 after flying from Winnipeg to Vancouver on June 19. Individuals in the affected rows of the airplane were advised to self-isolate for 14 days and monitor for symptoms. If symptoms develop, people are requested to self-isolate and get tested.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba entered phase 3 of reopening on June 21 with several restrictions easing throughout the province. Indoor gatherings of up to 50 people and outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people are allowed with physical distancing. These limits can be expanded if attendees split into separate groups that don't intermingle. If a group activity at a seniors centre is necessary, organizers are advised to consider limiting capacity to 25 people indoors, or one person per 10 square meters. Moreover, the 14-day self-isolation requirement is lifted for people coming into Manitoba on their way to cabins or tourist destinations from approximately six Canadian provinces and territories and with other exemptions. Retail businesses, restaurants and bars reopened at full capacity with distancing and without dance floors. Indoor recreation centres are allowed to operate at 50% capacity with social distancing and sanitation measures. Permanent outdoor amusement parks reopened at 50% capacity. Casinos and movie theatres have not yet reopened. Child-care centres reopened at normal capacity, but the maximum number of children in day camp groups is 50 students. Overnight camps, choirs, band camps and musical theatre are prohibited. Post-secondary schools intend to reopen by fall with restrictions. All health-care and therapeutic businesses, regulated or non-regulated, returned to normal occupancy with physical distancing.</p>
