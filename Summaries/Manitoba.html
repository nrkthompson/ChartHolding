  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective September 28, Winnipeg and 17 nearby areas will be moved to orange, or ‘restricted’ level, on the pandemic response scale -- following a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases. The new rules will be in place for at least four weeks: two incubation periods for the virus. Under the new level, masks will be mandatory in all indoor public places including bars and restaurants -- except while actually seated at a table to eat or drink. The mandatory mask rule will also apply to people who work with the public, but not to those in other workplaces. Public gatherings will be restricted to a maximum of 10 people, indoors and outdoors, which includes gatherings like weddings and funerals. New gathering sizes will not apply to places already under specific rules through current public health orders, including schools, restaurants, child-care facilities, retail stores, museums, theatres and casinos. A small number of faith-based organizations that previously opted for cohorting will need to switch over to observing capacity limits. The rules for organized sporting events will not change.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 21, Manitoba has 29 new COVID-19 cases -- with possible transmission occurring  on public transport and at restaurants. The health minister has warned Manitobans to comply with the safety measures in place in order to avoid the reinstitution of restrictions. On September 17, following a rise in COVID-19 cases in schools, the head of the union representing Manitoba teachers requested that the provincial government do more to reduce class sizes.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Students returned back to school on September 8 in Manitoba. The return to school is mandatory, although remote learning options are available for students who are immunocompromised. Parents who do not wish to send their children back to school must notify the province and home-school them instead.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba unveiled a new colour-coded system on August 19  that will allow the government to roll out COVID-19 restrictions targeting specific regions, communities or industries in the province. The new system has four risk levels, each triggering possible measures that public health officials can take to limit the spread of the virus. Similar to the existing forest-fire risk system, the pandemic response tool uses the colours green, yellow, orange and red. At each level, public health officials have a range of restrictions that could be imposed on different sectors, such as schools, restaurants, child-care centres and community gatherings As risk levels rise in a community or region, the province could tighten restrictions, such as reducing the size of gatherings or restricting travel in and out of an area. Manitoba as a whole is currently under the yellow "caution" risk level, meaning community transmission of COVID-19 is considered to be at low levels. The yellow level includes many restrictions Manitobans are already familiar with, such as limits on gathering sizes, restrictions on people returning from out of province, and directions to practise good hygiene and physical distancing. However, following the rise in COVID-19 cases in the southwestern region of Manitoba, gathering sizes will be restricted to 10 and face masks will be mandatory in public places within the Prairie Mountain Health region effective August 24. More clusters of infection, a higher test positivity rate and a number of large potential exposures at beaches and parks in the region led to the decision to raise the region's response level to orange.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 13, the government announced new measures for school reopening in the fall. On school buses, drivers and students in Grade 5 and up will be required to wear non-medical masks. Masks are strongly recommended--but not mandatory--for students from grades 5 to 12 in common areas and in spaces where physical distancing isn't possible.  If a COVID-19 case is detected at a school, closures will be considered as a last resort--and only if there is evidence of transmission among multiple groups of students or staff. Extra handwashing and sanitation stations will be set up and schools will need to clean commonly touched surfaces (like door handles), washrooms, and lunchrooms at least twice daily. Water fountains that are not touchless will be turned off. Staff will serve all food in cafeterias, and no shared containers will be allowed in lunchrooms. Schools are also asked to take ventilation into account in their back-to-school plans by avoiding air recirculation and by making sure air filters are clean.  Schools will need to schedule classes to avoid giving students spare periods, to limit bathroom occupancy at any given time, and to make sure students stay in smaller cohorts when two-metre distancing isn't possible. Parents who are uncomfortable sending their kids to school can homeschool them, but they won't be allowed to just keep them at home.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of August 7, new cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Manitoba, with most of them linked to a cluster in Brandon or to the close contacts of known COVID cases. The new cases include several young people, including some as young as 10. Manitobaís Premier warned Manitobans to follow health measures and orders to help stop the spread of COVID-19, but did not mention the possibility of mandatory face masks.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 30, the government of Manitoba announced its plan to reopen schools in fall.  There will be full time learning in classrooms for all students from kindergarten to Grade 8; high school students may have some remote learning--depending on whether schools can ensure physical distancing. COVID-19 prevention efforts are to be measured in levels, so the return to classes will begin at Level 1 in September, but this may be scaled up depending on COVID-19 cases in the province. Level 1 involves enforcing two metres of physical distancing between students to the greatest extent possible. When this is not possible, students will be organized into cohorts and space will be arranged to encourage separation, including the use of larger areas like multipurpose rooms. Schools will also need to limit gatherings in common areas such as lunchrooms and will be encouraged to use outdoor venues as much as possible. Lunches and recesses will be staggered and teachers will move between classrooms, instead of students, to limit the number of people gathering in hallways and schoolyards. Assemblies and gatherings that exceed whatever the current public health guidelines are at that time will not be permitted. Sports and gym classes can continue as long as they meet physical distancing requirements.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 23, the government announced its decision to postpone easing some restrictions following a public backlash to the governmentís briefing on entering Phase 4 of the deconfinement strategy. The plan for Phase 4 of reopening had proposed relaxing the 14-day self-isolation requirement for travellers from eastern and southern Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, along with an increase in the limit on public gatherings ó to 75 people from 50 indoors, and to 250 from 100 outdoors.  Both of these proposed changes are off the table for now. However, effective July 25, cinemas, casinos and movie theatres reopened and stage performances resumed, as planned under Phase 4 ó but at 30% capacity instead of the initially planned 50%. The same limits also apply for faith-based gatherings. The easing of restrictions on walk-up counter service in bars, beverage rooms, brew pubs, microbreweries and distilleries has been put on hold for now. Changes to visits at long-term and personal care homes also came into effect; each resident is now allowed to identify two support people who can visit them in their own rooms. Retail businesses and indoor recreation sites are able to use non-permeable barriers where two metre physical distancing is not possible. Although the province has backed off some of its immediate plans to loosen restrictions, the public health officer has warned people to maintain practices like handwashing, mask wearing and physical distancing to protect vulnerable people and reduce strain on the health-care system.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government announced an extension to its province-wide state of emergency, effective 15 July, for 30 days. It was first declared on March 20 and was further extended on April 18, May 17 and June 15. Provincial public health officials announced plans for further loosening outdoor gathering restrictions in the coming weeks but hosting large sporting events with an audience this fall will most likely be difficult.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba entered Phase 3 of its returning safe services plan on June 21, with many health order restrictions eased. However, restrictions on capacities for religious services, clubs and other indoor gatherings still remain in place. Although no new cases have been discovered since the reopening of Manitoba, the provincial chief public health officer is considering the idea of further action on health orders in the coming weeks, possibly including mandatory face masks by fall.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since Manitoba entered phase three of reopening on June 21, no new COVID-19 cases have been discovered as of July 4--with the exception of an individual who was tested positive on June 29 after flying from Winnipeg to Vancouver on June 19. Individuals in the affected rows of the airplane were advised to self-isolate for 14 days and monitor for symptoms. If symptoms develop, people are requested to self-isolate and get tested.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Manitoba entered phase 3 of reopening on June 21 with several restrictions easing throughout the province. Indoor gatherings of up to 50 people and outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people are allowed with physical distancing. These limits can be expanded if attendees split into separate groups that don't intermingle. If a group activity at a seniors centre is necessary, organizers are advised to consider limiting capacity to 25 people indoors, or one person per 10 square meters. Moreover, the 14-day self-isolation requirement is lifted for people coming into Manitoba on their way to cabins or tourist destinations from approximately six Canadian provinces and territories and with other exemptions. Retail businesses, restaurants and bars reopened at full capacity with distancing and without dance floors. Indoor recreation centres are allowed to operate at 50% capacity with social distancing and sanitation measures. Permanent outdoor amusement parks reopened at 50% capacity. Casinos and movie theatres have not yet reopened. Child-care centres reopened at normal capacity, but the maximum number of children in day camp groups is 50 students. Overnight camps, choirs, band camps and musical theatre are prohibited. Post-secondary schools intend to reopen by fall with restrictions. All health-care and therapeutic businesses, regulated or non-regulated, returned to normal occupancy with physical distancing.</p>
