      Mexican scientists are exploring sofosbuvir as a COVID-19 treatment. The Deputy Minister of Health continues encouraging Mexicans to limit contact, social distance and wear masks. Parts of Mexico have plateaued while other areas are experiencing more or fewer COVID-19 cases. Mexico's reopening stoplight indicators are determined by case trends, hospital admissions and occupancy, and the number of COVID-19 positive cases. During the week of June 15, 16 states progressed from red to orange in the reopening plan. In orange, states can open: restaurants and cinemas at 50% capacity; shopping centres and religious places at 25% capacity; contact services with appointments at 50% capacity; parks, squares, public spaces, gyms, pools and sports at 50% capacity, supermarkets and markets at 75% capacity with maximum one family member inside at once; and professional sports without audiences. As of June 9, Cancun, Isla Mujeres and other tourist based regions declared themselves reopened to direct flights from the US as did some hotels that implemented sanitary measures, and capacity limits between 15% and 30% for now. Beaches, clubs and casinos remain closed in those regions. Puerto Vallarta reopened hotels with capacity limits, malls, gyms and sporting facilities. An agreement between the federal and regional governments to protect the tourism industry allows certain regions to reopen while classified as red, or locked down. The US-Mexico border is expected to remain closed to non-essential travel until July 21. Health care workers continue to protest for wage increases, medical insurance, PPE and supplies.
