      Portugal’s national airline, TAP Air Portugal, resumed nonstop flights between Lisbon and Newark airport last week, following the completion of the country’s three-phase reopening strategy, with the formal  allowance of  E.U. citizens, except Spain and Italy, to enter via air on June 6. Although the country’s land border with Spain will remain closed until June 15, travellers arriving by air will not be required to quarantine but will have to face minimal health controls, in accordance to the country’s lockdown rules. Flights to and from selected countries such as the USA, UK, Canada and Brazil are scheduled to resume by mid June.76 Unlike some other countries now accepting tourists, mainland Portugal has discarded the requirement of a compulsory two week isolation period for the new arrivals. Upon experiencing a relatively COVID-19 free spring, hotels and other accommodations reopened last week, with local tourism boards awarding a new ‘Clean & Safe’ badge to hotels and restaurants who have implemented new hygiene measures, including no buffets. Additionally, beaches reopened on June 6, with an app launched to help monitor capacity and aid in maintaining distance between sunbathers.77 As of June 9, the government announced its plan to progress to the state of contingency, effective July 1, from the state of calamity, which has been in place since May 3,  if cases continue to decrease.78
