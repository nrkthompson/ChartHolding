      South Korea has been seeing a relatively stable level of new infections, fluctuating slightly around 40 per day. Sporadic outbreaks continue to occur at various venues while concentrating in the Seoul Metropolitan Region. Authorities urge renewed vigilance, especially among the elderly. Facilities deemed risky across the nation have begun adopting QR code entry logs, and they have until June 30 to complete the set-up. The national mask rationing scheme, originally set to end this month, has been extended to mid-July, with a higher purchase limit beginning June 18. Clinical trials for the anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, have been halted. The government confirmed a plan on June 15 to elevate the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) to an independent administrative body that can handle their own budget and personnel. The strengthened control measures for the Seoul Region, such as gathering bans on high-risk facilities and suspensions of public facility operation, have been extended until conditions improve. Around 8,000 facilities have been shut down accordingly and citizens are urged to adhere to health precautions and refrain from nonessential gatherings and outings. Businesses and services outside Seoul are able to operate as normal. Schools have reopened to all students while many students in lower grades are alternating between in-person and online classes. South Korea and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to grant quarantine exemptions for travel for essential purposes such as business and academics.
