      As of June 8, all primary schools in the Netherlands reopened completely for the first time since mid-March, after operating partially on alternate shifts since May 11. Effective June 15, the government also plans to reopen its borders for EU nationals as part of its phase three reopening strategy, in an effort to boost the tourism industry. Tourists from twelve EU states, which contain lower rates of COVID-19 cases, would be eligible to holiday in the Netherlands. These states are Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Estonia, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic. As of now, citizens of Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom cannot travel to the Netherlands. According to the Dutch authorities, foreign tourists must comply with all the measures and rules that apply in the country to combat the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, tourists are encouraged to reserve their holiday accommodation before they travel to the Netherlands, without which they may be stopped at the border.
