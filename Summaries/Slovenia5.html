      Effective June 15, public gatherings up to 500 people were permitted in Slovenia and spectators could also attend sporting events again. The 500 person capacity limit at sporting events will include athletes, media, security and support staff. All safety recommendations issued by the National Institute of Public Health continue to apply. Slovenia began easing border and travel restrictions on May 15, but after a month the border fence between Italy and Slovenia was taken down because of significant disruptions for town residents. Restriction-free travel to European countries is permitted with controls in place for those arriving from countries deemed high risk, such as the UK and Sweden. Travellers coming from outside of Europe must quarantine for 14 days, including residents who have been outside of the EU for a two week period.
