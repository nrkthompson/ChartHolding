  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the trend of new infections per day increased by 62%. The prime minister announced a new long-term strategy for COVID-19, emphasizing risk management and returning the situation in the country back to normal; social bubbles will be reduced to 5 close contacts per month, but this number will vary depending on the epidemiological situation. A close contact is someone who: you are physically close to; that you do not live with; and who you do not keep distance from or wear a mask around. People may gather in groups of up to 10 people, provided social distancing measures are followed. Despite the rising number of cases, several measures have been eased. Effective October 1, face masks will only be mandatory in crowded places, on public transport, and in cinemas. Also, the quarantine period has been reduced from 14 to 7 days Effective September 25, travelling to areas deemed high-risk by the government will no longer be forbidden but instead strongly discouraged. On September 30, the Coronalert smartphone app will be launched to aid in contact tracing efforts.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the number of new cases is increasing across the country -- unlike in July when infections rose mainly in city centres. The rise in infections may be related to the reopening of schools and travellers returning from high-risk countries. Health officials announced that ìthe number of new coronavirus infections is currently highest in the group of 10 to 20-year-olds.î Experts are concerned about the spike in cases and are recommending unilateral measures related to face masks to ensure rules do not vary by municipality.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Last week, all students returned to full day in-class learning with restrictions no longer in place on class sizes. In the early stages of the lock-down, class sizes were restricted and students were in small cohorts. This week, hundreds of students and some staff in Brussels have been quarantined due to a number of detected COVID-19 cases. In Brussels, social distancing rules have been reduced to 1 metre for both indoor and outdoor culture venues.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the average number of daily new infections is declining, but not quick enough. The government has chosen to prioritize the reopening of schools, prompting concern about the number of cases at the beginning of September. All students will be able to return to school full-time on September 1. Students over the age of 12 and teachers will be required to wear a mask. The national mandate to wear a face mask, where necessary, remains in effect. Effective August 24, up to 50 people will be allowed to attend funerals. The limit on public gatherings has been expanded to 200 people indoors and 400 outdoors. Shopping with a maximum of 2 people will be allowed, with a time limit no longer than 30 minutes. However, shopkeepers can decide to stick with a 1-person rule. Until the end of September, social contact bubbles of 5 will remain in effect.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In response to rising infection rates, Belgium has reintroduced restrictions on social gatherings. The government announced households will no longer be able to see 15 different people each week, but instead can see only 5. Masks are mandatory in many indoor and public environments, including crowded streets. In the Brussels-Capital region, COVID-19 fatigue has been connected to a lack of compliance with mandatory mask rules. The mandatory mask requirement in the region was implemented after the average number of new infections passed the threshold of 50 per 100,000 people. More than 200 people demonstrated in Brussels against COVID-19 restrictions after the regional government mandated wearing face masks in public. Despite having one of the highest mortality rates in the world, Belgium still lacks a full-time government 18 months since the last cabinet resigned.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the number of new cases continue to rise, as authorities work to curb incidence rates and boost the capacity of testing centres. The governmentís Autumn Strategy contains plans to increase testing from 28,000 tests to between 50,000-70,000 tests daily, increasing the countryís lab capacity, and additional testing stations. In Brussels, the use of face masks are mandatory on all commercial streets and in busy pedestrian zones. Health experts and officials disagree over whether Belgium is experiencing a second wave of infections.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 29, the PM announced the decision to not transition into phase 5 but instead to impose new COVID-19 restrictions for at least the next four weeks. Contact bubbles have been reduced from 15 to a fixed 5 people per household. However, groups of 10 can meet in public--provided social distancing is followed and face masks are used. This limit of 10 people also applies to receptions, banquets, and private gatherings, which has been reduced from 50 people. The government has reintroduced shopping alone measures, with a maximum time of 30 minutes per store. Moving forward, patrons at restaurants, bars, and wellness centres will have to register and leave their contact details. Public gathering restrictions have been cut in half: 100 people allowed indoors and 200 permitted at outdoors. The most affected province in Belgium--Antwerp--has imposed a curfew between 11:30 pm and 6:00 am. It has also closed fitness centres and adopted stricter controls in restaurants and bars. A new contact tracing app is being developed and is set to be released in September to boost the current efforts. Using Bluetooth technology, the data collected will provide information to authorities more quickly and efficiently to pinpoint emerging hotspots.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Rather than further relaxing restrictions at Phase 5 on August 1st, the National Security Council will implement new restrictions effective July 25. Face masks are now mandatory in public places such as markets, public buildings, and shopping streets. A curfew starting 10pm has been imposed for night shops, and clients in restaurants and bars will be asked to leave their contact details to facilitate contact tracing. A 15 person contact bubble will remain in place each week and the maximum number of people allowed at events will remain the same. Fairs and shows cannot resume in Belgium before September 1. Before entering the country, travellers will need to fill out an electronic form listing the places they visited abroad. Belgium is facing a second wave of infections after a steady increase in daily new infections. Young adults between 20 to 30 are the most frequently affected and the number of infections reflect more local flare-ups. Experts are emphasizing the importance of local lockdowns to help avoid another nationwide lockdown. Mayors of cities and municipalities will be able to take additional measures to combat local outbreaks, which can range from requiring face masks to implementing lockdowns.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government has published an updated list of EU regions and countries considered red or orange zones for travel. Non-essential travel to red zones is not permitted and it is recommended that travellers returning to Belgium from an orange zone self-isolate and get tested. As of July 14, countries in the orange zone include Upper Austria, Luxembourg, the UK, and the Trento region in Italy. Face masks are mandatory in cinemas and cannot be taken off during the film, with exceptions for the consumption of food or drink. Cinema operators are concerned about the new restrictionsí effects on profitability, which is already made difficult due to social distancing and reduced capacity regulations. The National Security Council has postponed its decision to further ease restrictions on August 1 due to a recent rise in infections. A decision on whether or not to move forward with Phase 5 will be made on July 23.  The PM said she could not rule out the reintroduction of lockdowns in the worst affected areas. A ban on nightclubs and other large gatherings remains in effect.  The current infection rate is highest among young people.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the government has decided not to reopen its borders to the 15 non-EU safe list countries decided by the EU Council. On July 7, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs updated the list of countries where Belgian citizens can travel for non-essential journeys. Belgians are unable to travel to Finland, Ireland, Malta, and Norway. Also, travel is not permitted to Leicester, a city in England, effective July 12, after it went back into lockdown following a spike in cases. On July 8, the government announced that travellers will be tested and quarantined on arrival, depending on whether they are returning from a high-risk country or region. The Belgian government will test returning travellers and place them in quarantine for a maximum of 14 days.  Even if a test is negative, quarantine will continue until a second retest is negative. Since no federal legal framework exists, Belgian travellers returning to the country from places with high infection rates cannot be forced into quarantine. In Flanders, travellers returning to Belgium from high-risk areas who do not quarantine could risk a fine of up to 4000 euros and up to six months in prison. However, prevention policies can be issued at the regional level. Belgiumís top virologist said that Belgians should not be allowed to travel abroad yet for holidays and that, as countries in Europe begin to see a resurgence, Belgium should be considering its plan for a second wave.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 1, Phase 4 of Belgiumís unlocking strategy came into effect. Contact bubbles have been extended to 15 people and public gatherings are allowed to have a maximum of 200 participants indoors or 400 outdoors. This number is expected to double on August 1. The curfew on restaurants and bars has been extended from 11:00 pm to 1:00 am. Cinemas and theatres can reopen. Also, swimming pools, wellness centres, and amusement parks can reopen. Nightclubs remain closed and are unlikely to reopen until the end of August. Despite the EU Councilís recommendation to begin lifting travel restrictions for the 15 countries whose citizens would be allowed to make non-essential trips to the EU on July 1, Belgium will not reopen its borders before July 7. People who were in close contact with a COVID-19 patient can now request a second test to shorten their mandatory 14-day quarantine to 10 days. If borders reopen on July 7, it is uncertain whether Belgium will follow the EU Councilís recommendations.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 23, the government announced that the country will move into phase 4 of its reopening strategy effective July 1. The curfew on restaurants and bars will be extended to 1:00 am. The current contact bubble will be expanded from 10 to 15 people and, unlike the current restrictions, can involve 15 different people every week. In phase 4 which begins July 1, cinemas and theatres can reopen, while maintaining a 1.5 metre distance. Likewise, cultural activities and sporting events can take place with an audience of 200 people indoors and 400 outdoors. Additionally, phase 4 allows swimming pools, wellness centres and amusement parks to reopen. In Belgium, it is no longer necessary to shop alone and the time limit in shops has been removed. Additionally in markets, there is no longer a limit on the number of stalls permitted. Nightclubs remain closed and will likely not reopen until the end of August. All non-essential travel outside the EU and Schengen area remains prohibited until July 1. Effective mid-August, every Belgian citizen is eligible to receive 12 free rail passes. Citizens can use the passes twice per month and are not allowed to use the tickets on the weekends or during the morning rush to alleviate crowding.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, non-essential travel resumed within the EU and Schengen zone. While arrivals are not subject to quarantine, airports have implemented measures which include temperature checks before departure and mandatory face coverings. Non-essential travel outside of the EU and Schengen zone remains banned. The distribution of face masks ordered by the federal government began on June 15, more than a month after the initial pledge to provide each resident with a mask. Over a 10 day period, 4,800 pharmacies will be responsible for distributing masks in stages organized by age group. A government decision to distribute 10 free rail tickets to all Belgians has been publicly opposed by the National Rail Company. The companyís board of directors agrees it would endanger the safety and health of passengers and staff and plans to postpone implementation of the decision to a later date when public health conditions improve. Two nursing federations are taking the government to court after accusing authorities of negligence toward health care staff and a lack of foresight in their management of COVID-19. The Interior Minister urged local officials to limit the right to protest in the interest of public health, in order to avoid a potential second wave.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 6, the Belgian government announced that it would be providing a free 10 journey rail pass to all residents in an effort to boost domestic tourism and the economy. The National Rail Company was concerned about these measures since social distancing on public transport is a key challenge as the country reopens. The lack of consultation raises questions related to safety, social distancing, and sanitation for travellers and staff. Phase 3 of Belgiumís reopening plan began on June 8, and almost all businesses are now operating including hotels, cafes and restaurants. Eateries can operate at 70% capacity and must maintain 1.5 metres between tables. While lakes and ponds are open, swimming pools remain closed across the country. On June 15, Belgium will reopen its borders to citizens within the Schengen area. Regional ministers, MPs, and local councillors were among the 10,000 people in Brussels who attended the Black Lives Matter demonstrations on June 7. Scientific experts are asking people who attended to strictly follow hygienic measures for 15 days and are expecting to see an impact on Belgiumís figures in the coming weeks from the protests. In response to demonstrations, the cabinet said that leaders will be announcing guidelines for protesting without breaking social-distancing and COVID-19 sanitary rules.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 8, Phase 3 of Belgiumís unlocking strategy is planned to resume and will relax the current restrictions to allow more than four people to visit each other's homes, permit groups of 20 people to play sports outdoors and allow capacity limits of up to 50 children at summer camps. Nightclubs remain closed, but all bars, restaurants, tourist attractions, camping sites, movie theatres and sports training and matches, will reopen.A Black Lives Matter protest scheduled for June 1 was cancelled after facing criticism that the event disregarded public safety by violating bans on gatherings. In Belgium, all airports are being flagged as high-risk areas for COVID-19 infection by the EASA, the country remains the only EU member state to have all its airports blacklisted. European rail operator, Thalys, will begin gradually resuming its international train services between the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany next week.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Interior Minister, Peter De Crem, said that if testing and contact tracing is not successful in managing a second wave of infections, it is likely that social distancing measures will be reimplemented in Belgium. Infrabel, the company responsible for Belgium's rail lines, are testing smart cameras with sensors to ensure its workers wear their masks and  maintain the new social distancing measures while on the job. While Belgium remains in their second phase, effective May 25th, changes occurred related to the easing of school closures. More grades at the primary and secondary level are able to return to school, with reopening being based on each schoolís organizational capacities. The third phase is set to begin on June 8th and will focus on the reopening of restaurants, cultural and sporting events, and hotels. Unlike the outbreaks seen in other countries, Belgium has managed to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks at their meat manufacturing plants due to strict regulations related to working conditions and the housing of migrant workers. Belgium is aiming to reopen to international tourists by June 15th but currently advises against all non-essential travel abroad.Belgium's mayors have asked regional ministers to stop prematurely communicating to citizens about measures related to the country's exit plan after news is being announced without having been officially approved. Also, doctors and health officials are criticizing the countryís contact tracing system as inefficient and uncoordinated.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Phase 2 of Belgiumís deconfinement strategy came into effect on May 18th, reopening schools, cultural sites, and amusement parks. Nursery schools are still closed but, primary and secondary lessons resumed with groups of 10 students per classroom. Measures are being enforced which include a minimum of 4 square metres per pupil and temperature checks for students and staff. Despite the reopening of zoos and parks, the cafeterias, restaurants, and playgrounds located on these grounds must stay closed. People cannot sit down, picnic, or sunbathe in the recently reopened parks. Across the country, teleworking remains the norm despite some businesses reopening. Belgium plans to reopen its borders to tourists on June 15th, conditional on the health risks in and around the country, and international agreements surrounding contact tracing. Frontline health workers expressed their disappointment in the Belgian governmentís handling of the crisis after staff formed a reception committee for the Prime Minister and turned their backs on her car upon arrival at a hospital in Brussels. Workers are unhappy with the government's attempts to recruit unqualified staff to provide support to nursing personnel rather than pay for trained professionals, in addition to budget cuts, low salaries, and staffing shortages.</p>
