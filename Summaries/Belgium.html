Currently, non-essential stores, museums, and swimming pools are open, with safety measures in place. Non-medical contact services, eateries, and amusement parks remain closed. On January 27, a ban on non-essential travel took effect that applies both to people within the country and foreign residents planning to travel to Belgium. The regional governments reached an agreement on stricter measures for youth activities but this still requires federal approval. The proposed measures would allow children to continue activities in bubbles of up to 10 and would limit their participation to one organized activity or group.</p> 
  <h5>January 25, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, 2,571 new daily cases of COVID-19 were reported on January 22. The current measures have been extended by an additional two weeks until March 1. Non-essential stores, museums, and swimming pools are open with safety measures in place. Non-medical contact services, eateries, and amusement parks remain closed. On January 27, a ban on non-essential travel will take effect and applies both to people within the country and foreign residents planning to travel to Belgium. The borders will remain open, but travel will only be permitted for professional or family reasons. The hospitality industry is pressuring the government to allow bars and restaurants to begin reopening in phases by March 1.</p> 
  <h5>January 18, 2021</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, 2,637 new daily cases of COVID-19 were reported on January 15. The current measures have been extended for an additional two weeks until March 1. Non-essential stores, museums, and swimming pools are open with safety measures in place. Non-medical contact services, eateries, and amusement parks remain closed. Curfews remain in place in the regions of Brussels, Wallonia, and Flanders. The media is criticizing the government’s extension of the current measures -- suggesting that it may have a negative impact on people’s willingness to follow the rules. On January 5, Belgium’s vaccination campaign began its first phase in nursing homes. The second phase will give priority to hospital and health professionals.</p> 
  <h5>December 21, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 18, Belgium reported a reproduction rate of 1.0 with variation between the provinces. The daily number of new COVID-19 infections continues to increase. Effective December 18, Ònon-residents entering Belgium must show a negative COVID-19 test certification in order to be permitted into the country.Ó The country plans to begin vaccinations on December 27. There are large regional differences in testing across the country, with efforts being made in Brussels and Wallonia to scale up testing efforts.</p> 
  <h5>December 14, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past week, the daily average of new COVID-19 cases in Belgium was 2,165. Children and teenagers represent 14% of COVID-19 infections in the country. Overall, infection, death, and hospitalization rates continue to slowly decrease in Belgium as a whole -- but are rising in the province of West Flanders. In response to the current restrictions, hairdressers set up their equipment in the streets to pressure authorities to allow them to reopen.</p> 
  <h5>December 7, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On December 3, Belgium reported 3,040 new daily cases of COVID-19. In Belgium, all major COVID-19 indicators continue to decrease. The government has agreed on a threshold that must be met before easing can occur -- including getting daily number of infections below 800 for 14 days and a maximum number of hospital admissions per day of 75. The most recent measures will be in effect until January 15 and include the reopening of non-essential businesses, museums, and swimming pools.</p> 
  <h5>November 30, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are declining again in Belgium; however, the decline in infections is slower than it was in early November. The majority of infections are being reported in people between the ages of 30 and 60. On November 26, BelgiumÕs reported death count surpassed 16,000. On November 27, the prime minister announced new measures will come into effect between December 1 and January 15, 2021. Non-essential shops can reopen but people must shop alone and can only stay in a shop for a maximum of 30 minutes. Swimming pools and museums are permitted to reopen. Other measures will not be eased until mid-January -- with an exception allowing people living alone to receive two close contacts in their homes on either December 24 or 25.</p>
  <h5>November 23, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, infection rates, deaths, and hospitalizations are slowly beginning to decrease across the country. Effective November 23, COVID-19 tests will become available for asymptomatic people who have had a high-risk contact or returned from a red-travel zone. The head of an intensive care hospital in Brussels called for the current COVID-19 measures to remain in place until 2021. BelgiumÕs Coronalert app has been downloaded about 2 million times in the country, prompting its developers to announce it has reached its efficiency threshold.</p>
  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the number of new infections and hospitalizations continue to decrease, but the average number of deaths have risen. Last week, Belgium entered its second national lockdown. The Brussels Health Inspectorate called on the government to adapt and expand the current COVID-19 testing strategy to include all high-risk contacts -- even those without symptoms.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">While the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 is decreasing, hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise in Belgium. The rates of cases and hospital admissions are double the current European average. Last week, Belgium entered its second national lockdown. Unions representing retail workers have agreed on a set of rules to better protect shop workers during the second wave.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 29, the government reported 21,048 daily new COVID-19 cases. Effective November 1, the government imposed a second national lockdown due to rising infections, hospital admissions, and deaths.At home, visitors have been limited to 1-2 close contacts and outdoor gatherings have been capped at 4 people. Funerals are limited to a maximum of 15 people. Non-essential shops and contact services, such as hairdressers and aestheticians, closed down. Teleworking has been made mandatory where possible. However, primary students will return to class after November 15. While only the first year of secondary students will return for in-person classes, the remainder of students would be split between in-person and distance learning. At higher education institutions, all schooling has been moved online. Curfews are in place but vary between BelgiumÕs major regions: Brussels, Flanders, and Wallonia. Health workers at hospitals who test positive for COVID-19 in northern Wallonia have been asked to continue working if theyÕre asymptomatic due to staff shortages. Due to ICU constraints, Belgium has transferred some patients to German hospitals.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 23, 227 daily new cases were reported with more than 2,700 COVID-19 patients hospitalized. Experts are warning that BelgiumÕs peak number of infections will likely not be reached for another 7-10 days. Due to an overwhelming demand, testing is now limited to only people with symptoms, while all non-urgent surgeries have been postponed to reduce the burden on hospitals. New measures were implemented on October 23 that will remain in place until November 19. Indoor sports where distancing is not possible, are banned for people over 12, while amusement parks have been closed. In theatres, cinemas, and concert halls, a maximum of 200 people is permitted. At post-secondary institutions, a capacity limit of 20% is allowed in classrooms along with masks deemed mandatory. Youth activities for children over 12 years old must be held outdoors but no overnight stays are permitted. ÒA senior virologist said that Belgium may return to a full lockdown if there is no reversal in infection numbers and hospital admissions continue to rise.Ó</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In the past week, there has been a sharp increase in cases, with an average of about 4,500 new COVID-19 cases per day. Belgium is one of ten countries deemed a red zone on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Controls coronavirus map, meaning the country has crossed the threshold of 120 confirmed infections per 100,000 people over a 14 day period. In response, the government announced several new restrictions: close bubbles have been reduced to a maximum of 3 people,  private home gatherings are limited to a maximum of 4 people, bars and cafes have a curfew of 11:00 pm, and only 4 people will be permitted per table. In the Brussels-Capital region all bars will be closing down, which includes cafes, cafeterias of sports clubs, and event halls.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">In the past week, there has been a sharp increase in cases, with an average of about 4,500 new COVID-19 cases per day. Belgium is one of ten countries deemed a red zone on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Controls coronavirus map because the country has crossed the threshold of 120 confirmed infections per 100,000 people over a 14 day period. In response to rising infections, hospital admissions and death rate, the government announced several new restrictions that will be in effect on October 9. Close bubbles have been reduced to a maximum of 3 people and private home gatherings are limited to a maximum of 4 people, not including those within the household. At bars and cafes, a curfew of 11:00 pm has been imposed and only 4 people will be permitted per table. In the Brussels-Capital region, all bars will be closing down, which includes cafes, cafeterias of sports clubs, and event halls.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite the rising number of new COVID-19 infections, Belgium continues to ease restrictions. In Brussels, face masks are no longer required in public, and will only need to be worn inside shops or in busy areas. Outside of the city centre, local authorities will have the jurisdiction to designate mask zones. The quarantine period has been reduced from 14 to 7 days. A COVID-19 Barometer has been introduced that will gather information from doctors on patient consultations related to complaints of respiratory problems, and the Òfrequency of complaints will be utilized as an indicator for the prevalence of COVID-19 in local areas and lead to targeted testing in certain areas of the country.Ó On September 30, the Coronalert smartphone app was launched following the decentralizing proximity tracing Apple-Google framework. Alexander De Croo has become the new prime minister in Belgium, more than a year after the last federal election.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the trend of new infections per day increased by 62%. The prime minister announced a new long-term strategy for COVID-19, emphasizing risk management and returning the situation in the country back to normal; social bubbles will be reduced to 5 close contacts per month, but this number will vary depending on the epidemiological situation. A close contact is someone who: you are physically close to; that you do not live with; and who you do not keep distance from or wear a mask around. People may gather in groups of up to 10 people, provided social distancing measures are followed. Despite the rising number of cases, several measures have been eased. Effective October 1, face masks will only be mandatory in crowded places, on public transport, and in cinemas. Also, the quarantine period has been reduced from 14 to 7 days Effective September 25, travelling to areas deemed high-risk by the government will no longer be forbidden but instead strongly discouraged. On September 30, the Coronalert smartphone app will be launched to aid in contact tracing efforts.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the number of new cases is increasing across the country -- unlike in July when infections rose mainly in city centres. The rise in infections may be related to the reopening of schools and travellers returning from high-risk countries. Health officials announced that “the number of new coronavirus infections is currently highest in the group of 10 to 20-year-olds.” Experts are concerned about the spike in cases and are recommending unilateral measures related to face masks to ensure rules do not vary by municipality.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Last week, all students returned to full day in-class learning with restrictions no longer in place on class sizes. In the early stages of the lock-down, class sizes were restricted and students were in small cohorts. This week, hundreds of students and some staff in Brussels have been quarantined due to a number of detected COVID-19 cases. In Brussels, social distancing rules have been reduced to 1 metre for both indoor and outdoor culture venues.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the average number of daily new infections is declining, but not quick enough. The government has chosen to prioritize the reopening of schools, prompting concern about the number of cases at the beginning of September. All students will be able to return to school full-time on September 1. Students over the age of 12 and teachers will be required to wear a mask. The national mandate to wear a face mask, where necessary, remains in effect. Effective August 24, up to 50 people will be allowed to attend funerals. The limit on public gatherings has been expanded to 200 people indoors and 400 outdoors. Shopping with a maximum of 2 people will be allowed, with a time limit no longer than 30 minutes. However, shopkeepers can decide to stick with a 1-person rule. Until the end of September, social contact bubbles of 5 will remain in effect.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In response to rising infection rates, Belgium has reintroduced restrictions on social gatherings. The government announced households will no longer be able to see 15 different people each week, but instead can see only 5. Masks are mandatory in many indoor and public environments, including crowded streets. In the Brussels-Capital region, COVID-19 fatigue has been connected to a lack of compliance with mandatory mask rules. The mandatory mask requirement in the region was implemented after the average number of new infections passed the threshold of 50 per 100,000 people. More than 200 people demonstrated in Brussels against COVID-19 restrictions after the regional government mandated wearing face masks in public. Despite having one of the highest mortality rates in the world, Belgium still lacks a full-time government 18 months since the last cabinet resigned.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the number of new cases continue to rise, as authorities work to curb incidence rates and boost the capacity of testing centres. The government’s Autumn Strategy contains plans to increase testing from 28,000 tests to between 50,000-70,000 tests daily, increasing the country’s lab capacity, and additional testing stations. In Brussels, the use of face masks are mandatory on all commercial streets and in busy pedestrian zones. Health experts and officials disagree over whether Belgium is experiencing a second wave of infections.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 29, the PM announced the decision to not transition into phase 5 but instead to impose new COVID-19 restrictions for at least the next four weeks. Contact bubbles have been reduced from 15 to a fixed 5 people per household. However, groups of 10 can meet in public--provided social distancing is followed and face masks are used. This limit of 10 people also applies to receptions, banquets, and private gatherings, which has been reduced from 50 people. The government has reintroduced shopping alone measures, with a maximum time of 30 minutes per store. Moving forward, patrons at restaurants, bars, and wellness centres will have to register and leave their contact details. Public gathering restrictions have been cut in half: 100 people allowed indoors and 200 permitted at outdoors. The most affected province in Belgium--Antwerp--has imposed a curfew between 11:30 pm and 6:00 am. It has also closed fitness centres and adopted stricter controls in restaurants and bars. A new contact tracing app is being developed and is set to be released in September to boost the current efforts. Using Bluetooth technology, the data collected will provide information to authorities more quickly and efficiently to pinpoint emerging hotspots.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Rather than further relaxing restrictions at Phase 5 on August 1st, the National Security Council will implement new restrictions effective July 25. Face masks are now mandatory in public places such as markets, public buildings, and shopping streets. A curfew starting 10pm has been imposed for night shops, and clients in restaurants and bars will be asked to leave their contact details to facilitate contact tracing. A 15 person contact bubble will remain in place each week and the maximum number of people allowed at events will remain the same. Fairs and shows cannot resume in Belgium before September 1. Before entering the country, travellers will need to fill out an electronic form listing the places they visited abroad. Belgium is facing a second wave of infections after a steady increase in daily new infections. Young adults between 20 to 30 are the most frequently affected and the number of infections reflect more local flare-ups. Experts are emphasizing the importance of local lockdowns to help avoid another nationwide lockdown. Mayors of cities and municipalities will be able to take additional measures to combat local outbreaks, which can range from requiring face masks to implementing lockdowns.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government has published an updated list of EU regions and countries considered red or orange zones for travel. Non-essential travel to red zones is not permitted and it is recommended that travellers returning to Belgium from an orange zone self-isolate and get tested. As of July 14, countries in the orange zone include Upper Austria, Luxembourg, the UK, and the Trento region in Italy. Face masks are mandatory in cinemas and cannot be taken off during the film, with exceptions for the consumption of food or drink. Cinema operators are concerned about the new restrictions’ effects on profitability, which is already made difficult due to social distancing and reduced capacity regulations. The National Security Council has postponed its decision to further ease restrictions on August 1 due to a recent rise in infections. A decision on whether or not to move forward with Phase 5 will be made on July 23.  The PM said she could not rule out the reintroduction of lockdowns in the worst affected areas. A ban on nightclubs and other large gatherings remains in effect.  The current infection rate is highest among young people.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">In Belgium, the government has decided not to reopen its borders to the 15 non-EU safe list countries decided by the EU Council. On July 7, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs updated the list of countries where Belgian citizens can travel for non-essential journeys. Belgians are unable to travel to Finland, Ireland, Malta, and Norway. Also, travel is not permitted to Leicester, a city in England, effective July 12, after it went back into lockdown following a spike in cases. On July 8, the government announced that travellers will be tested and quarantined on arrival, depending on whether they are returning from a high-risk country or region. The Belgian government will test returning travellers and place them in quarantine for a maximum of 14 days.  Even if a test is negative, quarantine will continue until a second retest is negative. Since no federal legal framework exists, Belgian travellers returning to the country from places with high infection rates cannot be forced into quarantine. In Flanders, travellers returning to Belgium from high-risk areas who do not quarantine could risk a fine of up to 4000 euros and up to six months in prison. However, prevention policies can be issued at the regional level. Belgium’s top virologist said that Belgians should not be allowed to travel abroad yet for holidays and that, as countries in Europe begin to see a resurgence, Belgium should be considering its plan for a second wave.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On July 1, Phase 4 of Belgium’s unlocking strategy came into effect. Contact bubbles have been extended to 15 people and public gatherings are allowed to have a maximum of 200 participants indoors or 400 outdoors. This number is expected to double on August 1. The curfew on restaurants and bars has been extended from 11:00 pm to 1:00 am. Cinemas and theatres can reopen. Also, swimming pools, wellness centres, and amusement parks can reopen. Nightclubs remain closed and are unlikely to reopen until the end of August. Despite the EU Council’s recommendation to begin lifting travel restrictions for the 15 countries whose citizens would be allowed to make non-essential trips to the EU on July 1, Belgium will not reopen its borders before July 7. People who were in close contact with a COVID-19 patient can now request a second test to shorten their mandatory 14-day quarantine to 10 days. If borders reopen on July 7, it is uncertain whether Belgium will follow the EU Council’s recommendations.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 23, the government announced that the country will move into phase 4 of its reopening strategy effective July 1. The curfew on restaurants and bars will be extended to 1:00 am. The current contact bubble will be expanded from 10 to 15 people and, unlike the current restrictions, can involve 15 different people every week. In phase 4 which begins July 1, cinemas and theatres can reopen, while maintaining a 1.5 metre distance. Likewise, cultural activities and sporting events can take place with an audience of 200 people indoors and 400 outdoors. Additionally, phase 4 allows swimming pools, wellness centres and amusement parks to reopen. In Belgium, it is no longer necessary to shop alone and the time limit in shops has been removed. Additionally in markets, there is no longer a limit on the number of stalls permitted. Nightclubs remain closed and will likely not reopen until the end of August. All non-essential travel outside the EU and Schengen area remains prohibited until July 1. Effective mid-August, every Belgian citizen is eligible to receive 12 free rail passes. Citizens can use the passes twice per month and are not allowed to use the tickets on the weekends or during the morning rush to alleviate crowding.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 15, non-essential travel resumed within the EU and Schengen zone. While arrivals are not subject to quarantine, airports have implemented measures which include temperature checks before departure and mandatory face coverings. Non-essential travel outside of the EU and Schengen zone remains banned. The distribution of face masks ordered by the federal government began on June 15, more than a month after the initial pledge to provide each resident with a mask. Over a 10 day period, 4,800 pharmacies will be responsible for distributing masks in stages organized by age group. A government decision to distribute 10 free rail tickets to all Belgians has been publicly opposed by the National Rail Company. The company’s board of directors agrees it would endanger the safety and health of passengers and staff and plans to postpone implementation of the decision to a later date when public health conditions improve. Two nursing federations are taking the government to court after accusing authorities of negligence toward health care staff and a lack of foresight in their management of COVID-19. The Interior Minister urged local officials to limit the right to protest in the interest of public health, in order to avoid a potential second wave.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 6, the Belgian government announced that it would be providing a free 10 journey rail pass to all residents in an effort to boost domestic tourism and the economy. The National Rail Company was concerned about these measures since social distancing on public transport is a key challenge as the country reopens. The lack of consultation raises questions related to safety, social distancing, and sanitation for travellers and staff. Phase 3 of Belgium’s reopening plan began on June 8, and almost all businesses are now operating including hotels, cafes and restaurants. Eateries can operate at 70% capacity and must maintain 1.5 metres between tables. While lakes and ponds are open, swimming pools remain closed across the country. On June 15, Belgium will reopen its borders to citizens within the Schengen area. Regional ministers, MPs, and local councillors were among the 10,000 people in Brussels who attended the Black Lives Matter demonstrations on June 7. Scientific experts are asking people who attended to strictly follow hygienic measures for 15 days and are expecting to see an impact on Belgium’s figures in the coming weeks from the protests. In response to demonstrations, the cabinet said that leaders will be announcing guidelines for protesting without breaking social-distancing and COVID-19 sanitary rules.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 8, Phase 3 of Belgium’s unlocking strategy is planned to resume and will relax the current restrictions to allow more than four people to visit each other's homes, permit groups of 20 people to play sports outdoors and allow capacity limits of up to 50 children at summer camps. Nightclubs remain closed, but all bars, restaurants, tourist attractions, camping sites, movie theatres and sports training and matches, will reopen.A Black Lives Matter protest scheduled for June 1 was cancelled after facing criticism that the event disregarded public safety by violating bans on gatherings. In Belgium, all airports are being flagged as high-risk areas for COVID-19 infection by the EASA, the country remains the only EU member state to have all its airports blacklisted. European rail operator, Thalys, will begin gradually resuming its international train services between the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany next week.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Interior Minister, Peter De Crem, said that if testing and contact tracing is not successful in managing a second wave of infections, it is likely that social distancing measures will be reimplemented in Belgium. Infrabel, the company responsible for Belgium's rail lines, are testing smart cameras with sensors to ensure its workers wear their masks and  maintain the new social distancing measures while on the job. While Belgium remains in their second phase, effective May 25th, changes occurred related to the easing of school closures. More grades at the primary and secondary level are able to return to school, with reopening being based on each school’s organizational capacities. The third phase is set to begin on June 8th and will focus on the reopening of restaurants, cultural and sporting events, and hotels. Unlike the outbreaks seen in other countries, Belgium has managed to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks at their meat manufacturing plants due to strict regulations related to working conditions and the housing of migrant workers. Belgium is aiming to reopen to international tourists by June 15th but currently advises against all non-essential travel abroad.Belgium's mayors have asked regional ministers to stop prematurely communicating to citizens about measures related to the country's exit plan after news is being announced without having been officially approved. Also, doctors and health officials are criticizing the country’s contact tracing system as inefficient and uncoordinated.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Phase 2 of Belgium’s deconfinement strategy came into effect on May 18th, reopening schools, cultural sites, and amusement parks. Nursery schools are still closed but, primary and secondary lessons resumed with groups of 10 students per classroom. Measures are being enforced which include a minimum of 4 square metres per pupil and temperature checks for students and staff. Despite the reopening of zoos and parks, the cafeterias, restaurants, and playgrounds located on these grounds must stay closed. People cannot sit down, picnic, or sunbathe in the recently reopened parks. Across the country, teleworking remains the norm despite some businesses reopening. Belgium plans to reopen its borders to tourists on June 15th, conditional on the health risks in and around the country, and international agreements surrounding contact tracing. Frontline health workers expressed their disappointment in the Belgian government’s handling of the crisis after staff formed a reception committee for the Prime Minister and turned their backs on her car upon arrival at a hospital in Brussels. Workers are unhappy with the government's attempts to recruit unqualified staff to provide support to nursing personnel rather than pay for trained professionals, in addition to budget cuts, low salaries, and staffing shortages.</p>
