      Mexican scientists are exploring sofosbuvir as a COVID-19 treatment. The Deputy Minister of Health continues encouraging Mexicans to limit contact, social distance and wear masks. Parts of Mexico have plateaued while other areas are experiencing more or fewer COVID-19 cases. Mexico's reopening stoplight indicators are determined by case trends, hospital admissions and occupancy, and the number of COVID-19 positive cases. During the week of June 15, 16 states progressed from red to orange in the reopening plan. In orange, states can open: restaurants and cinemas at 50% capacity; shopping centres and religious places at 25% capacity; contact services with appointments at 50% capacity; parks, squares, public spaces, gyms, pools and sports at 50% capacity, supermarkets and markets at 75% capacity with maximum one family member inside at once; and professional sports without audiences. As of June 9, Cancun, Isla Mujeres and other tourist based regions declared themselves reopened to direct flights from the US as did some hotels that implemented sanitary measures, and capacity limits between 15% and 30% for now. Beaches, clubs and casinos remain closed in those regions. Puerto Vallarta reopened hotels with capacity limits, malls, gyms and sporting facilities. An agreement between the federal and regional governments to protect the tourism industry allows certain regions to reopen while classified as red, or locked down. The US-Mexico border is expected to remain closed to non-essential travel until July 21. Health care workers continue to protest for wage increases, medical insurance, PPE and supplies.

      Per 100,000 people, Mexico ranked seventh globally for the most COVID-19 deaths and fourteenth for the most cases as of June 9. Four states experienced increases in COVID-19 cases greater than 100%, five states reported downward trends in cases and one state maintained the same level of active cases for two weeks. Several hospitals reported themselves at capacity. On June 9, Deputy Minister of Health Hugo Lopez-Gatell stated that Mexico’s daily number of new cases had not peaked and that the country would experience additional weeks of rising daily numbers of cases. In Mexico City, masks are required. Although most of the country is in lockdown, as of June 1, with some restrictions being relaxed, general movement in Mexico increased. In lockdown, hotels have limited capacity, personal care services can be in-home with appointments, parks are open in some regions and essential services are open. With intergovernmental cooperation, preparations for the tourism sector are underway by exploring travel insurance, discounts and mobile reservations. Medical staff protest lack of appropriate PPE. The government was criticized for relaxing restrictions while the country is peaking and expert estimates for the COVID-19 death toll increased from 16,000 to between 43,000 and 51,000 this summer. Attention towards excessive police force is growing after Giovanni Lopez was killed in police custody while being detained for not wearing a mask.

      On June 3, Mexico revealed its highest daily death toll  at 1092. On May 28, May 29 and June 2, Mexico received ventilators and PPE from the US and China. To expand their testing rate, 114 more clinics and hospitals will conduct tests and implement contact tracing techniques. On June 1, Mexico entered their final stage of reopening and implemented a traffic light system to reopen social, school and economic activities varying by region. Federal and regional governments will collaborate to determine regional reopening. Masks and social distancing are required in public. Parts of the mining, construction, auto parts, tourism, equipment manufacturing, public markets, public parks, businesses and beer production sectors resumed with restrictions. Reopening is restricted in areas with high numbers of cases, which government maps reflect as most of the country. On August 10, three week long remedial schools begin in person in regions of Mexico classified as fully open. Elementary schools will resume during the first week of September, and middle and upper level schools will resume in person on September 21 with health restrictions. Mexican experts concur with the stoplight system, but disagree with the timing and suggest that the country has not plateaued and that restrictions should ease after a two week decline of cases. Experts advocate for more testing and different health measures for public transport. Caravan protests in 40 cities called for President Lopez-Obrador’s resignation; the president responded by reminding protestors of opportunities in 2021 and 2022 to remove him from office before his mandate ends in 2024.

      The WHO praised Mexico’s response to the pandemic for their economic support plan and their decision to maintain Mexico’s epidemiological response plan to COVID-19 until the situation improves. Mexico received masks and ventilators from China on May 22 and 23. Mexico will not fully reopen until a vaccine is circulated, but as companies begin reopening some companies committed to doing employee testing. The Mexico-US border will remain closed to non-essential travel until June 22. As of May 18, construction, mining and automaking reopened. On June 1, the Mexican reopening plan will incorporate a traffic light system to reopen different sectors of society in different regions. Mexico City remains closed until minimum June 15 with exceptions for essential services. Depending on the number of  hospitalizations, the capital will reopen hotels and cinemas in July, schools and offices in August followed by bars and gyms in September. At a press conference on May 29th, the government explained that most, but not all, of Mexico remained locked down, which would gradually ease and allow more non-essential services to reopen as of June 1st based on risk and expected social value. Companies must register with the government virtually prior to reopening. Schools will continue virtual learning with free textbooks and various educational telecommunications programs. To reopen schools, regions must achieve green status, or the final stage of reopening, but the government anticipates that remedial courses will reopen in person in August and schools in September. The Maya Train project in the Chiapas is reopening. Cancun and Mexico will be one of the first locations in the Americas to receive approval through the Global Safety Stamp by the World Travel and Tourism Council.

      Mexico City expects their peak between the end of May and beginning of June. Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab therapies are authorized by relevant government agencies and are being tested in hospitals. Mexico is looking to approve additional therapies including using convalescent plasma. 2000 ventilators arrived from the US and an 11th flight arrived from China with ventilators, COVID-19 tests, gloves, and material to produce N95 masks. Although authorized in Mexico’s reopening plan, 26 out of approximately 203 municipalities in Oaxaca that reported no COVID-19 cases decided not to reopen on May 18th. As of May 18th, construction, mining, and automaking services could resume and approximately 28 textile and automotive companies received approval from the Secretary of Health to reopen with 20-30% of their workforce. The government requests people stay home until May 30th and insists reopening will be gradual. In preview of a second wave of COVID-19 in October, the government may enforce additional measures regionally to avoid the negative impact of national restrictions. The government may also keep the changes that they made to public hospitals that increased their patient capacity and will continue buying supplies and PPE from China to stay equipped. Medical staff continue protesting the quality and quantity of available PPE and other supplies. Some governors are not pleased with how federalism worked during the pandemic and argue that it should be reviewed.
