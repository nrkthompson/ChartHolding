      Although there are emerging sporadic outbreaks, Japan has seen an overall low level of new infections over the past weeks. Tokyo continues to be the hotbed of new cases. While saliva-based tests were approved on June 2, targeted testing will replace blanket tests in the future. Reopening progresses nationwide. Most businesses and services have already reopened with rules of physical distancing and hygiene. Professional sports must wait until June 19 to resume. Japan is now considering reopening its borders to business travellers from countries with low levels of infections and strong economic ties such as Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are Trans-Pacific Partnership members.153
