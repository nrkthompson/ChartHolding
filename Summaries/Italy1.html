      In its second phase of reopening, hospital networks across Italy have increased their number of beds and reduced the number of patients requiring intensive care, showing that the situation is currently sustainable for future phases. Italy will begin testing a representative sample of 150,000 people across 2,000 cities next week in order to understand the extent of COVID-19’s impact on the country. Restrictions on shops, eateries, and churches were eased on May 18, but social distancing measures will remain in effect. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to operate with a limited capacity, and no standing room will be available at the bar. There is widespread discontent among restaurant and bar owners with regard to the guidelines set by the national government, with many arguing that the rules are unclear, and that the sector requires more concrete help in order to stay open. On May 25, gyms, pools, and sport centres will be allowed to reopen. The Italian government plans to begin easing restrictions on movement, announcing on May 16 that all airports will be permitted to continue domestic and international travel by June 3.
