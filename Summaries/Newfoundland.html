      Currently, Newfoundland and Labrador is at Alert phase 2 where retail stores, malls, spas, salons and tattoo parlours reopened. Outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people are permitted and the two-household bubble has been expanded to include an additional 6 people. New members of this extended bubble do not have to be from the same household. Places of worship may resume without public gathering restrictions. Campsites are open with limitations on overnight camping and outdoor pools. Large playgrounds, gyms, fitness facilities, indoor pools and performance spaces are open. Restaurants have reopened at a reduced capacity and buffets remain closed. Bars, lounges, cinemas, and theatres are open with reduced capacity. Distance learning continues, summer camps are operating, and daycare operations are being expanded. The province is lifting restrictions slowly compared to other provinces with similar epidemiological conditions. The government is struggling to maintain broad public support for COVID-19 restrictions. Effective July 3, an Atlantic bubble agreement was made to allow free movement between Atlantic provinces without self-isolation. The province plans to begin easing travel restrictions with other provinces on July 17.
