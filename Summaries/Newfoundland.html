  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Newfoundland and Labrador continues to be at Alert Level 2, with no detailed timeline for when the province will move to Alert Level 1. Alert Level 1 represents the new normal and a way to move forward until a vaccine for COVID-19 is available. On July 6, the government released a plan with three potential scenarios for reopening schools in September, dependent on the regional spread of COVID-19. School districts will determine which scenario to implement, in consultation with public health authorities in their region. The first scenario is that schools are open and instruction resumes in-class as normal with public health measures in place. The second involves schools being partially opened with the schoolâ€™s population split up into alternating schedules. The last scenario is full time at-home learning, which may require teachers to be in school to support students with learning or behavioural disabilities. The return to school plan will include a COVID-19 assessment sheet that must be filled out each morning by parents or students asking about their travel history and any symptoms. The PC Education Critic and the NDP Education Critic said the plan lacked necessary details, and they were both highly critical of the burden placed on school districts to shift through the three scenarios.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Newfoundland and Labrador is at Alert Phase 2. Bars and nightclubs reopened, but dance floors remain prohibited and capacity is restricted. Despite this, overcrowding and dancing continues in many establishments. On July 4, historic sites will reopen with a one-way flow pattern for visitors with designated entry and exit doors where possible. Effective July 3, residents of Atlantic Canada can resume travel within the region without having to self-isolate for 14 days when arriving in another province. Visitors from outside the region will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and, once this period has passed, can travel within the Atlantic region. Premier Dwight Ball said that if the Atlantic bubble is successful it could be expanded to other provinces on July 17. However, many are concerned about whether the Atlantic bubble is in the best interest of the province. The government is being criticized for planning to allow non-essential travel despite the continued day-to-day restrictions.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Currently, Newfoundland and Labrador is at Alert phase 2 where retail stores, malls, spas, salons and tattoo parlours reopened. Outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people are permitted and the two-household bubble has been expanded to include an additional 6 people. New members of this extended bubble do not have to be from the same household. Places of worship may resume without public gathering restrictions. Campsites are open with limitations on overnight camping and outdoor pools. Large playgrounds, gyms, fitness facilities, indoor pools and performance spaces are open. Restaurants have reopened at a reduced capacity and buffets remain closed. Bars, lounges, cinemas, and theatres are open with reduced capacity. Distance learning continues, summer camps are operating, and daycare operations are being expanded. The province is lifting restrictions slowly compared to other provinces with similar epidemiological conditions. The government is struggling to maintain broad public support for COVID-19 restrictions. Effective July 3, an Atlantic bubble agreement was made to allow free movement between Atlantic provinces without self-isolation. The province plans to begin easing travel restrictions with other provinces on July 17.</p>
