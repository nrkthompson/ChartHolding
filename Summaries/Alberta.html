  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since June 12, Alberta has remained in Phase 2 of its reopening strategy--with some relaxing of public gathering restrictions and more businesses reopening. Outdoor gathering limits were increased from 100 to 200 people on June 30 for events such as festivals, sporting events, and outdoor performances. Seated events must be arranged to maintain physical distancing and compliance with public health measures. Other outdoor private gatherings, such as weddings or funerals, remain capped at 100 people. Across the province, there is a backlog of cattle waiting to be processed at meatpacking plants due to temporary shutdowns and a reduction in operations due to COVID-19 outbreaks. A news report from the Tourism Industry of Alberta Association found that between 60% and 70% of small-to-medium sized tourism businesses could close. 72,000 people in the province work in the tourism industry. The province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health addressed concerns related to the public health risks associated with Edmonton becoming an NHL hub city. Teams that will be in COVID-19 bubbles could regularly come in contact with other teams, but would have little-to-no close contact with anyone outside the bubble. Players would be subject to extensive testing from private labs but the chief medical officer said that free public testing will remain the province’s priority.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Phase 2 of Alberta’s relaunch strategy came into effect on June 12 with additional businesses and services reopening. In phase 2 grades K-12 can resume for diploma exams and summer school only. Along with retail businesses and hairstylists, wellness and personal services, libraries, cinemas and theatres can reopen. Indoor recreation, fitness, and sports facilities can now reopen in phase 2. An infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary critiques that this limits government ability to monitor progress between phases. Many small businesses are struggling with PPE shortages, recalling laid-off workers,  implementing new measures to protect staff and customers, and financial burdens. There is no limit on the number of people allowed at worship gatherings or eateries, but there is a maximum of 50 attendees at indoor gatherings and 100 at outdoor events. Sports teams may play in region-only cohorts of up to 50 players. In phase 2, households may increase their social bubbles to a maximum of 15 people. Non-essential travel outside the province is not recommended and restrictions are still in place for major festivals, conferences, nightclubs and amusement parks.</p>
