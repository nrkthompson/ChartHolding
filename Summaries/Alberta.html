  <h5>November 16, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta has one of the highest active case rates in Canada, with record numbers of new cases, active cases, and hospitalization occupancy rates. New restrictions have been put in place for the next two weeks in Edmonton, Calgary, Grand Prairie, Lethbridge, Fort McMurray, and Red Deer. Indoor group fitness, team sports and group performances have been suspended and weddings and funerals cannot exceed 50 people. Restaurants, bars, and pubs must close by 11:00 pm and liquor sales must stop by 10:00 pm. The opposition leader criticized the government for waiting too long to introduce restrictions and the minimal measures being added.</p>
  <h5>November 9, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On November 7, 919 new cases were reported in Alberta -- along with new record highs for hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and active cases. COVID-19 transmission is related to exposure in households or private gatherings but many newly confirmed cases have unknown sources. Due to high case numbers, contact tracers will no longer be able to notify people in close contact with an infected person. Experts are pressuring the Alberta government to impose new public health measures. Alberta has not adopted the national COVID-19 contact tracing app and continues to recommend its own ABTraceTogether app.</p>
  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 30, Alberta reported “622 new daily cases, reaching record numbers everyday over the past week.” There is a high number of new cases among young people, especially among people 10-19 years old, despite a decline in the number of young people being tested. In Edmonton and Calgary, a new mandatory limit of 15 people came into effect on private social gatherings, including weddings and funerals. “The province is also recommending voluntary measures in both cities which include wearing non-medical masks in all indoor work settings.”</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of October 23, there are 432 new COVID-19 cases in Alberta. Two weeks since voluntary measures were put in place by the province, Edmonton still has half of the current number of active cases. The government has decided to stop testing people who are asymptomatic or who have not had contact with a confirmed case. On November 2, a pilot project will be launched for travelers entering Canada by land or air through Alberta. Travelers will have the option of being tested at the border to shorten the self-isolation period from 14 days to 48 hours if they receive a negative test result.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Alberta, with the highest hospitalization numbers since the pandemic began in March. The majority of infections are in Edmonton and Calgary, with 41% of cases related to outbreaks in acute care. In response to the voluntary restrictions introduced by the province, Edmonton announced measures limiting the number of spectators to 25% at its public facilities. “COVID-19 assessment centres reported a high number of people not showing up for booked tests, resulting in delays in available appointments,” and there is an increasing number of people testing positive for COVID-19 who are not sharing all the necessary information with contact tracers. With 43% of new cases having no known source, experts are concerned that Alberta will not slow the spread.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta reached its highest number of new cases since April, with a large outbreak in Edmonton. The rise in cases has been linked to outbreaks at continuing care centres and schools in the province. Voluntary health measures were introduced in Edmonton due to a rise in cases linked to “symptomatic people attending work or social gatherings while awaiting test results.” As of October 8, the province is recommending private gatherings in Edmonton not exceed 15 people and that masks are worn in all indoor settings to help lower the rate of COVID-19 infections.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of cases in the province continue to rise with the majority of cases in Edmonton and Calgary. Alberta remains in Stage 2 of its reopening plan with several schools reporting outbreaks. “Alberta Health data shows that the number of new daily cases is increasing among school-aged children and teens, but so too has the number of young people being tested.” After parents expressed confusion about what symptoms warrant keeping their children home from school, the province has added an information chart online to improve their communication efforts surrounding school re-openings safely.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of cases in Alberta is rising, with the majority occurring in Edmonton and Calgary. Alberta remains in Stage 2 of its reopening plan. Several schools are reporting outbreaks. Indoor play places have been added to the list of businesses safe to continue operating. Measures in place will include physical distancing, enhanced cleaning, and reduced capacity. Prime Minister Trudeau told Canadians that Alberta is among the provinces already experiencing a second wave -- in contrast to a statement issued by the province’s chief medical officer of health. Despite a rise in the number of new daily cases, Dr. Hinshaw thinks that Alberta is not yet in a second wave of the pandemic.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta remains in Stage 2 of its reopening plan. With COVID-19 case counts rising in many communities, kids back in schools, and more people returning to work, many public health experts agree that the "social bubbles" that worked as a safe approach earlier in the pandemic now come with more risk. Following their reopening, Alberta schools have reported a number of outbreaks.In response, an online map was launched that lists every school with an outbreak. The map will be used to help parents track outbreaks. Alberta Health Services is launching a booking tool in the next few weeks for people to schedule visits with loved ones living in continuing care and hospice settings.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The number of active cases continues to rise in Alberta but the province does not plan to introduce stricter measures. A few days after students returned to schools, ìAlberta has reported its first COVID-19 outbreak at two public high schools in Calgary and Lethbridge.î In Edmonton, schools have cases and several hundred students and staff are in isolation.  Also in Edmonton, COVID-19 fears have led to a citywide bus driver shortage and students are expected to face delays in arriving at school.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">More than half of the active cases in Alberta are in Edmonton. The majority of the cityís outbreaks are among people under age 40 with links to household transmission, social gatherings, and faith-based groups. In the province, COVID-19 discussions are focused on reopening schools in September prompting the government to release protocols for possible outbreaks. Protocols will be triggered if there are two or more confirmed cases and will result in a decision about whether to go online or close schools. Parents, teachers, and educational assistants want the government to fund a better plan for kids to safely return to school that includes emotional support for students, adequate equipment, and an effective online learning plan.  Effective September 1, 234 pharmacies owned by Loblaws, including Superstore and Shoppers Drug Mart, will offer asymptomatic testing in an effort by Alberta Health Services to boost the provinceís testing capacity. This additional capacity is needed to test 90,000 teachers and school staff in the next few weeks.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta remains in Stage 2 of its reopening plan with public health measures still in place. Alberta will switch from its ABTraceTogether app to the federal COVID-19 notification app. This decision comes after the Premier accused the federal government in mid-July of preventing the province from working with Apple and Google to fix their appís problems. In Calgary, all staff and students from kindergarten to Grade 12 will be required to wear masks in public and Catholic schools. The new Calgary Board of Education and Calgary Catholic School District mandates go beyond provincial guidelines, which require masks from Grade 4 to 12. Some southern Alberta First Nations will adopt a separate arrangement for the reopening of schools on reserves. Students at Kainai Nation will implement a hybrid model that splits students into two cohorts; the cohorts will attend classes on alternating days of the week.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government has made several adjustments to its original back to school plan. Masks will be mandatory for all school staff and students grade 4-12 in public spaces. Teachers and staff will be supplied one face shield to be used alongside a mask. For younger students, masks will be optional.  The decision is based on evidence that children 10 and under are less likely to transmit COVID-19. Students can choose to remove their masks when they are seated in class. The government will provide schools with two contactless thermometers and school districts will share 466,000 litres of hand sanitizer. The government will provide two reusable masks to every student, teacher, staff, and bus driver in the province. Approximately 1.6 million masks will be distributed. Diploma exams have resumed for grade 12 summer students, but students and parents want the government to make these mandatory exams voluntary. Public libraries in Edmonton reopened on August 4 with restrictions including mandatory masks, physical distancing, capacity limits, and shortened visits.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta remains in phase two as cases continue to rise across the province. The premier said the provinceís policy response to small outbreaks in specific regions will involve targeted lockdowns but should involve reverting back to a total lockdown. Only a significant spread would warrant a province-wide lockdown. In Banff, masks are now mandatory in indoor public spaces and outdoors along main streets. Edmontonís City Council is considering a temporary bylaw that would fine those not wearing masks in any indoor public places $100. The government continues to defend its back to school plan despite concerns from parents and school boards. The Calgary Board of Education wants additional funds to cover the implementation of COVID-19 health and sanitary measures. The education minister said that school boards have flexibility within their budgets to cover these costs and said that the plan follows the advice of public health officials, school boards, and superintendents. The NDP provided an alternative back to school plan that included hiring extra teachers and expanding into other facilities in order to ensure a classroom cap of 15 students.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta currently has the highest per-capita rate of active cases in Canada, with thirteen regions under a watch designation. The high number of cases has caused concern among experts, doctors, and politicians. Data from Alberta shows more young people are being infected within the 20-29 age group, making up a higher percentage of overall positive COVID-19  cases. Health experts and business leaders are praising Calgaryís City Council after it voted to make masks mandatory in indoor public spaces, including on transport, effective August 1. Edmontonís City Council plans to implement a similar mask bylaw. Edmontonís mayor has said enforcement will be difficult and has called on the provincial government to make face coverings in public mandatory. The Education Minister outlined the provinceís school reopening plan, which included physical distancing and enhanced cleaning measures but did not include limits on class sizes or mandatory mask rules. The Alberta Teachers Association and several school boards are concerned about where the money will come from for classroom retrofits, additional cleaning supplies, and hand sanitizer. The Alberta NDP criticized the reopening plan, saying educators and families are being put at risk because of the unclear guidelines on physical distancing and a lack of new funding.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No date has been set for Stage 3 of Albertaís reopening plan due to an increase in COVID-19 infections. In Calgary, two parts of the city that previously had low infection rates are now on a watch list. Both areas have many bars and restaurants where young people tend to congregate; the majority of new cases are among younger people. Health experts are concerned about COVID-19 fatigue as Albertans appear to be ignoring public health guidelines and protective measures that exist as a condition of the provinceís reopening plans. The United Nurses of Alberta and the Alberta Federation of Labour called on the government to make wearing a mask mandatory in all indoor public places. Calgaryís mayor is planning to bring forward a draft bylaw on July 20 that may make masks mandatory in certain situations in the city.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta remains in Phase 2 of their reopening plan. On July 13, the second round of the provincial program providing non-medical masks to Albertans through drive-thrus is set to resume after being paused for three weeks. In June, 20 million masks were distributed through restaurants, municipalities, long-term care facilities, and on reserves. Another 20 millions masks will be distributed through 600 A&Ws, McDonalds, and Tim Hortons. New restrictions have been enacted for Siksika First Nations after an outbreak on a reserve. A curfew will be in place from 11 pm to 5 am and public gatherings are being limited to 10 people, despite the province allowing for 200 person gatherings. Union leaders representing grocery store workers are telling MPs that there is no reason for large grocery chains to cut pandemic pay premiums since COVID-19 has not gone away. The leaders want stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since June 12, Alberta has remained in Phase 2 of its reopening strategy--with some relaxing of public gathering restrictions and more businesses reopening. Outdoor gathering limits were increased from 100 to 200 people on June 30 for events such as festivals, sporting events, and outdoor performances. Seated events must be arranged to maintain physical distancing and compliance with public health measures. Other outdoor private gatherings, such as weddings or funerals, remain capped at 100 people. Across the province, there is a backlog of cattle waiting to be processed at meatpacking plants due to temporary shutdowns and a reduction in operations due to COVID-19 outbreaks. A news report from the Tourism Industry of Alberta Association found that between 60% and 70% of small-to-medium sized tourism businesses could close. 72,000 people in the province work in the tourism industry. The provinceís Chief Medical Officer of Health addressed concerns related to the public health risks associated with Edmonton becoming an NHL hub city. Teams that will be in COVID-19 bubbles could regularly come in contact with other teams, but would have little-to-no close contact with anyone outside the bubble. Players would be subject to extensive testing from private labs but the chief medical officer said that free public testing will remain the provinceís priority.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Phase 2 of Albertaís relaunch strategy came into effect on June 12 with additional businesses and services reopening. In phase 2 grades K-12 can resume for diploma exams and summer school only. Along with retail businesses and hairstylists, wellness and personal services, libraries, cinemas and theatres can reopen. Indoor recreation, fitness, and sports facilities can now reopen in phase 2. An infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary critiques that this limits government ability to monitor progress between phases. Many small businesses are struggling with PPE shortages, recalling laid-off workers,  implementing new measures to protect staff and customers, and financial burdens. There is no limit on the number of people allowed at worship gatherings or eateries, but there is a maximum of 50 attendees at indoor gatherings and 100 at outdoor events. Sports teams may play in region-only cohorts of up to 50 players. In phase 2, households may increase their social bubbles to a maximum of 15 people. Non-essential travel outside the province is not recommended and restrictions are still in place for major festivals, conferences, nightclubs and amusement parks.</p>
