  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government has made several adjustments to its original back to school plan. Masks will be mandatory for all school staff and students grade 4-12 in public spaces. Teachers and staff will be supplied one face shield to be used alongside a mask. For younger students, masks will be optional.  The decision is based on evidence that children 10 and under are less likely to transmit COVID-19. Students can choose to remove their masks when they are seated in class. The government will provide schools with two contactless thermometers and school districts will share 466,000 litres of hand sanitizer. The government will provide two reusable masks to every student, teacher, staff, and bus driver in the province. Approximately 1.6 million masks will be distributed. Diploma exams have resumed for grade 12 summer students, but students and parents want the government to make these mandatory exams voluntary. Public libraries in Edmonton reopened on August 4 with restrictions including mandatory masks, physical distancing, capacity limits, and shortened visits.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta remains in phase two as cases continue to rise across the province. The premier said the province’s policy response to small outbreaks in specific regions will involve targeted lockdowns but should involve reverting back to a total lockdown. Only a significant spread would warrant a province-wide lockdown. In Banff, masks are now mandatory in indoor public spaces and outdoors along main streets. Edmonton’s City Council is considering a temporary bylaw that would fine those not wearing masks in any indoor public places $100. The government continues to defend its back to school plan despite concerns from parents and school boards. The Calgary Board of Education wants additional funds to cover the implementation of COVID-19 health and sanitary measures. The education minister said that school boards have flexibility within their budgets to cover these costs and said that the plan follows the advice of public health officials, school boards, and superintendents. The NDP provided an alternative back to school plan that included hiring extra teachers and expanding into other facilities in order to ensure a classroom cap of 15 students.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta currently has the highest per-capita rate of active cases in Canada, with thirteen regions under a watch designation. The high number of cases has caused concern among experts, doctors, and politicians. Data from Alberta shows more young people are being infected within the 20-29 age group, making up a higher percentage of overall positive COVID-19  cases. Health experts and business leaders are praising Calgary’s City Council after it voted to make masks mandatory in indoor public spaces, including on transport, effective August 1. Edmonton’s City Council plans to implement a similar mask bylaw. Edmonton’s mayor has said enforcement will be difficult and has called on the provincial government to make face coverings in public mandatory. The Education Minister outlined the province’s school reopening plan, which included physical distancing and enhanced cleaning measures but did not include limits on class sizes or mandatory mask rules. The Alberta Teachers Association and several school boards are concerned about where the money will come from for classroom retrofits, additional cleaning supplies, and hand sanitizer. The Alberta NDP criticized the reopening plan, saying educators and families are being put at risk because of the unclear guidelines on physical distancing and a lack of new funding.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">No date has been set for Stage 3 of Alberta’s reopening plan due to an increase in COVID-19 infections. In Calgary, two parts of the city that previously had low infection rates are now on a watch list. Both areas have many bars and restaurants where young people tend to congregate; the majority of new cases are among younger people. Health experts are concerned about COVID-19 fatigue as Albertans appear to be ignoring public health guidelines and protective measures that exist as a condition of the province’s reopening plans. The United Nurses of Alberta and the Alberta Federation of Labour called on the government to make wearing a mask mandatory in all indoor public places. Calgary’s mayor is planning to bring forward a draft bylaw on July 20 that may make masks mandatory in certain situations in the city.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Alberta remains in Phase 2 of their reopening plan. On July 13, the second round of the provincial program providing non-medical masks to Albertans through drive-thrus is set to resume after being paused for three weeks. In June, 20 million masks were distributed through restaurants, municipalities, long-term care facilities, and on reserves. Another 20 millions masks will be distributed through 600 A&Ws, McDonalds, and Tim Hortons. New restrictions have been enacted for Siksika First Nations after an outbreak on a reserve. A curfew will be in place from 11 pm to 5 am and public gatherings are being limited to 10 people, despite the province allowing for 200 person gatherings. Union leaders representing grocery store workers are telling MPs that there is no reason for large grocery chains to cut pandemic pay premiums since COVID-19 has not gone away. The leaders want stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Since June 12, Alberta has remained in Phase 2 of its reopening strategy--with some relaxing of public gathering restrictions and more businesses reopening. Outdoor gathering limits were increased from 100 to 200 people on June 30 for events such as festivals, sporting events, and outdoor performances. Seated events must be arranged to maintain physical distancing and compliance with public health measures. Other outdoor private gatherings, such as weddings or funerals, remain capped at 100 people. Across the province, there is a backlog of cattle waiting to be processed at meatpacking plants due to temporary shutdowns and a reduction in operations due to COVID-19 outbreaks. A news report from the Tourism Industry of Alberta Association found that between 60% and 70% of small-to-medium sized tourism businesses could close. 72,000 people in the province work in the tourism industry. The province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health addressed concerns related to the public health risks associated with Edmonton becoming an NHL hub city. Teams that will be in COVID-19 bubbles could regularly come in contact with other teams, but would have little-to-no close contact with anyone outside the bubble. Players would be subject to extensive testing from private labs but the chief medical officer said that free public testing will remain the province’s priority.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Phase 2 of Alberta’s relaunch strategy came into effect on June 12 with additional businesses and services reopening. In phase 2 grades K-12 can resume for diploma exams and summer school only. Along with retail businesses and hairstylists, wellness and personal services, libraries, cinemas and theatres can reopen. Indoor recreation, fitness, and sports facilities can now reopen in phase 2. An infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary critiques that this limits government ability to monitor progress between phases. Many small businesses are struggling with PPE shortages, recalling laid-off workers,  implementing new measures to protect staff and customers, and financial burdens. There is no limit on the number of people allowed at worship gatherings or eateries, but there is a maximum of 50 attendees at indoor gatherings and 100 at outdoor events. Sports teams may play in region-only cohorts of up to 50 players. In phase 2, households may increase their social bubbles to a maximum of 15 people. Non-essential travel outside the province is not recommended and restrictions are still in place for major festivals, conferences, nightclubs and amusement parks.</p>
