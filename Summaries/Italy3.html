      On June 1, several cultural sites reopened including the Vatican Museums, the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa, under measures which include physical distancing, and temperature checks. On June 20, Italy’s Serie A soccer league will resume. Freedom of movement was restored on June 3 allowing Italians to travel freely in the country and EU visitors to enter without quarantine requirements. In response, regional governors are pressing for some ability to trace tourists or to test them to ensure that transmission is contained. In four of Italy’s twenty regions, contact tracing apps are currently being used to help the country avoid a second wave. Four weeks into the country’s easing plan, the number of cases continues to decline, resulting in some Italian doctors suggesting that “the virus no longer exists in Italy.” The Head of Milan’s San Raffaele Hospital urged the Italian government to continue lifting measures, arguing preparations for a second wave are creating unnecessary fear. However, the Health Minister said there is insufficient evidence to back up these claims and urged Italians to continue following guidelines. On Italy’s Republic Day, Orange Vest protests emerged across  regional capitals. Hundreds gathered to protest the government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis and to call for its resignation. In Rome, the parties making up the opposition held a joint rally against the government's policies. These protests defied government orders to maintain social distancing and to use masks in busy spaces.
