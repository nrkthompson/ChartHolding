      The government-sponsored contact tracing app will be discontinued in Norway. Data agency officials said that the low infection rate in Norway and the low number of downloads of the app made the invasion of privacy from its operation disproportionate to its benefit for contact tracing. Public health officials said they would respect the ruling but vehemently disagreed with the assessment of the app, saying that the decision will weaken the country’s response to the pandemic. Only 600,000 of the nearly 5.5 million people in the country had downloaded the app. Family members of Norwegians who live outside the EU/EEA will now be permitted to visit, though they will still be subject to a ten day quarantine on arrival. The new guidelines were issued after a loophole in the previous regulations was discovered that allowed the families of EU citizens living in Norway, but not the families of Norwegian citizens, to enter the country.
