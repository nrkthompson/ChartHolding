  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 4, a temporary health care facility that can treat approximately 250 patients opened in the Rio Grande Valley. On August 8, the Houston Astros and the Texas Division of Emergency Management opened a free COVID-19 testing centre at Minute Maid Park in Houston; the centre can process up to 2000 tests daily. Texas’ governor urged Texans to get the flu vaccine and reminded the public to wear masks, social distance, sanitize and avoid gatherings. The governor also said that masks are needed to slow the spread of the virus and decrease the need to shut down again. Texas is preparing to send PPE (masks, sanitizer, thermometers and face shields) to Texas school districts for the 2020-2021 school year, at no cost to the school districts. Local school boards can decide how and when they would reopen in-person. School boards will have a four-week transition where they can operate remotely if needed. Remote learning can be extended for an additional four weeks with a school board vote and a waiver.  Extension beyond eight weeks will be reviewed by the Texas Education Agency on a case-by-case basis.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Reports describe Texas’ resurgence of cases beginning in mid-June, with an increase in the COVID-19 death toll by July. On July 29, Texas reported a daily record for COVID-19 related fatalities. Its case count now exceeds that of New York. The hotspot for cases in Texas is in Rio Grande Valley where reports indicate that hospitals began reaching their capacity earlier in July. Doctors in Texas are urging residents to get the flu shot to lower the burden of the flu on health care systems in the fall.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On Monday July 20, Texas reported a 7-day average of 118.57 deaths, an increase of 39% compared to the week of July 13. Similarly, the state reported a 15% increase in new cases and a 6% increase in hospitalizations compared to the week of July 13. US House representatives Sheila Jackson Lee and Joaquin Castro urged the Texas governor to scale back Texas’ reopening and to permit local jurisdictions to implement stay-at-home orders. They also said that the state was encouraged to reopen by President Trump instead of being guided by scientific evidence.  They claim that Texas has become an example of what should not be done and pointed to an unpublished White House document that lists Texas as one of 18 states where the outbreak is out of control. A pediatrics expert at Northwestern University advised against reopening schools in states like Texas and California that have a high surge of cases now. On July 25, some Texas bar owners defied bar closure orders, protesting a rule that allows restaurants serving alcohol and food to remain open.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 3, masks became mandatory in public in counties with 20 or more active cases and carried fines for failure to comply. On July 13, the governor announced that the US Department of Defense activated more US Army Urban Augmentation Medical Task Forces to fight COVID-19. One task force arrived on July 6 in San Antonio, another on July 13 in Houston, and four more will be deployed along with a US Navy Acute Care Team and four US Navy Rapid Rural Response teams across Texas for medical support. Texas has been facing a surge since Memorial Day and about one month after reopening. Several hospitals in Texas are not accepting transfer patients in order to ensure that they are able to handle an anticipated increase in cases. In response, patients have been flown to other hospitals and have to wait for up to 10 hours for hospital admission via ambulance. Other short-of-staff hospitals have refused patients and some are trying extraordinary measures to make additional room. Some hospitals are close to full and doctors have suggested that there may be shortages of antiviral drugs. In June, the governor began slowing elective procedures. He later ordered bars to close and lowered the restaurant capacity cap to 50%. As of the week of July 13, Texas was looking at stopping elective surgeries in 100 counties and returning to a lockdown. The Dallas Independent School District Superintendent is unsure whether the district will be able to reopen in person by August 17; the Board of Trustees will meet to determine how to proceed and establish start date recommendations.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California, Texas, Arizona and Florida account for 50% of cases in the US. The rate at which people are testing positive is 26% in Texas. Texas set a new record for its COVID-19 deaths in one day on July 9, and reported 9610 hospitalizations--which is 46% higher than the week of June 29. The south Texas county of Brooks made it legal to arrest COVID-19 patients who appear in public before being cleared for reasons other than medical attention. In Texas’ plan for reopening schools, masks will be mandatory for students and teachers in counties with more than 20 cases; school districts must have in-person instruction for students, but parents may opt for virtual learning. The guidelines also refer to having hand sanitizers at every entrance and encouraging social distancing and handwashing at least twice daily. Educators and the teachers association are unhappy that they were not consulted in establishing the guidelines for schools and were not provided with an option to teach remotely.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Austin area set a record for the number of daily new cases. Austin’s mayor is now considering a stay-at-home order. The local health authority recommended mandatory mask wearing for one year. As of July 1, more than 300 children and 600 staff in child care facilities have been tested positive for COVID-19 and the number continues increasing. Masks are now required in Texas. On June 26, Texas closed its bars in response to increasing cases in cities. Businesses are protesting the closure of bars. Additional federal funding will support Texas hospitals and patients with Medicaid. Local officials are concerned over potentially overwhelming hospitalizations in major Texas cities.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With more than 5000 new daily cases, Texas has a record number of hospitalizations and is seeing a general rise in cases compared to last week. The governor is requesting Texans to stay home and warns that restrictions may be announced if the infection rate continues. The governor paused the state’s reopening at phase 3 of 4 on June 25 after a daily increase of almost 6000 cases. Texas mayors and county judges now have the right to implement restrictions on outdoor gatherings greater than 100 people. Some health officials and Harris County officials are demanding stricter stay-at-home orders. A Houston university professor estimates that Texas ICUs will fill over the next two weeks and contribute to increasing mortality rates and limited treatment abilities. Republican Senator Ted Cruz is contesting a federal decision to revoke funding for 13 community-based COVID-19 testing centres by the end of June, which affects seven Texas areas that have increasing COVID-19 cases.</p>
