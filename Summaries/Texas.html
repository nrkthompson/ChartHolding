  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 3, masks became mandatory in public in counties with 20 or more active cases and carried fines for failure to comply. On July 13, the governor announced that the US Department of Defense activated more US Army Urban Augmentation Medical Task Forces to fight COVID-19. One task force arrived on July 6 in San Antonio, another on July 13 in Houston, and four more will be deployed along with a US Navy Acute Care Team and four US Navy Rapid Rural Response teams across Texas for medical support. Texas has been facing a surge since Memorial Day and about one month after reopening. Several hospitals in Texas are not accepting transfer patients in order to ensure that they are able to handle an anticipated increase in cases. In response, patients have been flown to other hospitals and have to wait for up to 10 hours for hospital admission via ambulance. Other short-of-staff hospitals have refused patients and some are trying extraordinary measures to make additional room. Some hospitals are close to full and doctors have suggested that there may be shortages of antiviral drugs. In June, the governor began slowing elective procedures. He later ordered bars to close and lowered the restaurant capacity cap to 50%. As of the week of July 13, Texas was looking at stopping elective surgeries in 100 counties and returning to a lockdown. The Dallas Independent School District Superintendent is unsure whether the district will be able to reopen in person by August 17; the Board of Trustees will meet to determine how to proceed and establish start date recommendations.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California, Texas, Arizona and Florida account for 50% of cases in the US. The rate at which people are testing positive is 26% in Texas. Texas set a new record for its COVID-19 deaths in one day on July 9, and reported 9610 hospitalizations--which is 46% higher than the week of June 29. The south Texas county of Brooks made it legal to arrest COVID-19 patients who appear in public before being cleared for reasons other than medical attention. In Texas’ plan for reopening schools, masks will be mandatory for students and teachers in counties with more than 20 cases; school districts must have in-person instruction for students, but parents may opt for virtual learning. The guidelines also refer to having hand sanitizers at every entrance and encouraging social distancing and handwashing at least twice daily. Educators and the teachers association are unhappy that they were not consulted in establishing the guidelines for schools and were not provided with an option to teach remotely.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Austin area set a record for the number of daily new cases. Austin’s mayor is now considering a stay-at-home order. The local health authority recommended mandatory mask wearing for one year. As of July 1, more than 300 children and 600 staff in child care facilities have been tested positive for COVID-19 and the number continues increasing. Masks are now required in Texas. On June 26, Texas closed its bars in response to increasing cases in cities. Businesses are protesting the closure of bars. Additional federal funding will support Texas hospitals and patients with Medicaid. Local officials are concerned over potentially overwhelming hospitalizations in major Texas cities.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With more than 5000 new daily cases, Texas has a record number of hospitalizations and is seeing a general rise in cases compared to last week. The governor is requesting Texans to stay home and warns that restrictions may be announced if the infection rate continues. The governor paused the state’s reopening at phase 3 of 4 on June 25 after a daily increase of almost 6000 cases. Texas mayors and county judges now have the right to implement restrictions on outdoor gatherings greater than 100 people. Some health officials and Harris County officials are demanding stricter stay-at-home orders. A Houston university professor estimates that Texas ICUs will fill over the next two weeks and contribute to increasing mortality rates and limited treatment abilities. Republican Senator Ted Cruz is contesting a federal decision to revoke funding for 13 community-based COVID-19 testing centres by the end of June, which affects seven Texas areas that have increasing COVID-19 cases.</p>
