  <h5>November 2, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 29, Texas reported their highest daily increase in COVID-19 deaths in three weeks, and the number of hospitalizations decreased for the first time in six days. On October 28, Texas’ number of hospitalizations fell from 5,650 to 5,587. On October 29, Texas reported their weekly average of cases as 6,122. As of October 30, Texas had over 100,000 active COVID-19 cases. After an increase in COVID-19 cases and in the positivity rate, El Paso officials requested that residents stay home and imposed a curfew from 10 pm to 5 am on October 29. Officials also forced nonessential businesses to close for two weeks. With the lockdown, in-person dining, bars, gyms, and personal care services must close. Texas’ attorney general and some restaurants in the county are suing the county to prevent the closure —arguing that County Judge Samaniego did not have the authority to impose the restrictions. Houston public health experts are warning of a possible third wave of infections.</p>
  <h5>October 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Texas reported 81 new deaths and 6,125 new COVID-19 cases on October 24, the  highest daily number of new cases since August 19. The positivity rate is 9.28%. The weekly average of cases increased 13% in the last week, hospitalizations increased 17% and testing fell 7%. As of October 26, Texas had the second most cumulative COVID-19 cases in the US with 892,000 cases. El Paso County imposed a curfew between 10pm and 5am, where people must stay home unless they are travelling for work or essential services and only one person per family may access essential services at the same time. Fines of $250 will also be distributed in the county for failing to wear a mask.</p>
  <h5>October 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 15, Texas reported 4,263 hospitalizations, the most since August. Texas reported an average 3,800 new daily cases, the highest since September. Experts suggest the rise in cases is due to more social gatherings and COVID-19 fatigue. October 14 was the first day bars could reopen at 50% if their counties met the criteria of having a COVID-19 hospital occupancy rate lower than 15% and as of October 14 approximately 85 out of 254 qualified. On October 14, certain businesses, like amusement parks, museums and gyms that are in counties that met the same criteria mentioned above could also expand their capacities to 75%. On October 16, El Paso city and country leaders imposed restrictions on restaurants and businesses following a record high of daily new cases at 717 and a COVID-19 hospital occupancy rate of 28%. The restrictions cap non-essential business capacity at 50%, stop visitations to elderly care facilities, limit outdoor gatherings to 10, stop indoor sports, prohibit sports spectators and only allow restaurants to offer take-out and delivery after 9pm.</p>
  <h5>October 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On October 9, Texas reported 27.83 cases per 1000 people and 57,278 cases in the past two weeks. Texas also reported 95 deaths, 3,650 new COVID-19 cases and added 386 cases that had not been counted before. As of October 14, the governor is allowing bars to open at 50% capacity and with specific health measures if the county qualifies and judges opt their counties in. Qualifying counties must have fewer than 15% COVID-19 hospital occupancy. Business other than bars in those areas will be permitted up to 75% capacity. As of October 7, Texas passed California and became the state with the second most COVID-19 deaths.</p>
  <h5>October 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Texas health officials are preparing for an increase of cases in the fall because of the return to school and COVID-19 preventive measures being eased in parts of the state that are seeing a rise in cases. A partnership between the US Department of Health and Human Services and Texas governments is supporting increased testing in McLennan County by establishing new testing sites. Sam Houston State and the Texas State University System are hiring approximately 200 COVID-19 contact tracers. More inmates have died from COVID-19 in Texas than in any other prison system in the US, with a death toll of approximately 162 inmates. A federal judge is requiring the Texas prison system to increase their COVID-19 protective measures, such as providing hand sanitizer to some inmates in a geriatric facility. Some local Texas business owners and the Texas Border Coalition are asking the Department of Homeland Security Secretary to reopen the US-Mexico border to nonessential travel to prevent negative economic repercussions. Earlier in September, U.S. House of Representatives Congressman, Henry Cuellar, proposed a plan to allow nonessential travel into Texas.</p>
  <h5>September 28, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 27, Texas reported a total of over 735,000 cases and more than 15,500 deaths. Several prominent Republican politicians, including the chairman of the Texas GOP, have filed a lawsuit against Texas’ Republican governor for adding six additional early voting days to the calendar. Several Republican politicians also criticized the governor’s COVID-19 response, including Steve Toth, a member of the Texas House of Representatives, who said that 15 days of flattening the curve became six miserable months for small business owners.</p>
  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of September 16, Texas became the state with the second highest number of COVID-19 cases, leaving only California with more cases. Texas changed its way of calculating positivity rates and will now take the date that the test was conducted into account, instead of relying solely on the date when the COVID-19 case was confirmed. As of September 17, gyms, museums, libraries, restaurants, retailers and other businesses can operate at 75% capacity. As class resumed in person, hundreds of Texas teachers reported that districts in the state were not abiding by COVID-19 health regulations. Teachers are also concerned about insufficient ventilation, a lack of space for social distancing, a lack of PPE, and a lack of access to accommodations for employees at the school and their family members. Teachers in Texas must return in person or may face unemployment. A bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers -- noting disparities in internet access -- called on the governor to create a plan for increased broadband to permit remote learning and working.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On September 7, Texasí governor extended the stateís Disaster Declaration for COVID-19 to ensure necessary access to resources and strategies. The governor continues to urge Texans to wear masks, social distance and sanitize. Universities in Texas suggest that off-campus parties are the cause behind some of the increase in COVID-19 cases in areas around universities, yet only a few schools have acted to discipline students. Some of the schools that are disciplining students for violating health and safety measures are fining students, suspending Greek houses and students, increasing university campus police patrols off-campus and encouraging the community to report concerning student behaviour.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The North East and San Antonio Independent school districts intend to hold in-person classes for students in stages. Students will begin virtually and gradually progress to in-person classes. If the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations decreases and Texasí positivity rate falls below 10% for a sustained period of time, the Governor may allow bars to reopen. Several bars in San Antonio reopened in August by classifying their establishments as restaurants with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. This classification means that they must have a full kitchen and that food and merchandise constitute more than 51% of their sales. The Commission said they will conduct up to 2000 inspections weekly to ensure compliance.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">During the week of August 8, Texas reported a 42% drop in the number of tests conducted. The positivity rate increased 20% on average. Harris Countyís school reopening plan includes suggestions from local leaders that schools should not open in person as long as the countyís COVID-19 threat level indicator is at level one or Code Red.  To reopen schools in Houston, officials want the cityís positive test rate to reach 5% or lower. Before reopening bars, Texasís governor wants to see hospitalizations decrease and the stateís positive rate of infections fall under 10% for a sustained time period.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On August 4, a temporary health care facility that can treat approximately 250 patients opened in the Rio Grande Valley. On August 8, the Houston Astros and the Texas Division of Emergency Management opened a free COVID-19 testing centre at Minute Maid Park in Houston; the centre can process up to 2000 tests daily. Texasí governor urged Texans to get the flu vaccine and reminded the public to wear masks, social distance, sanitize and avoid gatherings. The governor also said that masks are needed to slow the spread of the virus and decrease the need to shut down again. Texas is preparing to send PPE (masks, sanitizer, thermometers and face shields) to Texas school districts for the 2020-2021 school year, at no cost to the school districts. Local school boards can decide how and when they would reopen in-person. School boards will have a four-week transition where they can operate remotely if needed. Remote learning can be extended for an additional four weeks with a school board vote and a waiver.  Extension beyond eight weeks will be reviewed by the Texas Education Agency on a case-by-case basis.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Reports describe Texasí resurgence of cases beginning in mid-June, with an increase in the COVID-19 death toll by July. On July 29, Texas reported a daily record for COVID-19 related fatalities. Its case count now exceeds that of New York. The hotspot for cases in Texas is in Rio Grande Valley where reports indicate that hospitals began reaching their capacity earlier in July. Doctors in Texas are urging residents to get the flu shot to lower the burden of the flu on health care systems in the fall.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On Monday July 20, Texas reported a 7-day average of 118.57 deaths, an increase of 39% compared to the week of July 13. Similarly, the state reported a 15% increase in new cases and a 6% increase in hospitalizations compared to the week of July 13. US House representatives Sheila Jackson Lee and Joaquin Castro urged the Texas governor to scale back Texasí reopening and to permit local jurisdictions to implement stay-at-home orders. They also said that the state was encouraged to reopen by President Trump instead of being guided by scientific evidence.  They claim that Texas has become an example of what should not be done and pointed to an unpublished White House document that lists Texas as one of 18 states where the outbreak is out of control. A pediatrics expert at Northwestern University advised against reopening schools in states like Texas and California that have a high surge of cases now. On July 25, some Texas bar owners defied bar closure orders, protesting a rule that allows restaurants serving alcohol and food to remain open.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Effective July 3, masks became mandatory in public in counties with 20 or more active cases and carried fines for failure to comply. On July 13, the governor announced that the US Department of Defense activated more US Army Urban Augmentation Medical Task Forces to fight COVID-19. One task force arrived on July 6 in San Antonio, another on July 13 in Houston, and four more will be deployed along with a US Navy Acute Care Team and four US Navy Rapid Rural Response teams across Texas for medical support. Texas has been facing a surge since Memorial Day and about one month after reopening. Several hospitals in Texas are not accepting transfer patients in order to ensure that they are able to handle an anticipated increase in cases. In response, patients have been flown to other hospitals and have to wait for up to 10 hours for hospital admission via ambulance. Other short-of-staff hospitals have refused patients and some are trying extraordinary measures to make additional room. Some hospitals are close to full and doctors have suggested that there may be shortages of antiviral drugs. In June, the governor began slowing elective procedures. He later ordered bars to close and lowered the restaurant capacity cap to 50%. As of the week of July 13, Texas was looking at stopping elective surgeries in 100 counties and returning to a lockdown. The Dallas Independent School District Superintendent is unsure whether the district will be able to reopen in person by August 17; the Board of Trustees will meet to determine how to proceed and establish start date recommendations.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">California, Texas, Arizona and Florida account for 50% of cases in the US. The rate at which people are testing positive is 26% in Texas. Texas set a new record for its COVID-19 deaths in one day on July 9, and reported 9610 hospitalizations--which is 46% higher than the week of June 29. The south Texas county of Brooks made it legal to arrest COVID-19 patients who appear in public before being cleared for reasons other than medical attention. In Texasí plan for reopening schools, masks will be mandatory for students and teachers in counties with more than 20 cases; school districts must have in-person instruction for students, but parents may opt for virtual learning. The guidelines also refer to having hand sanitizers at every entrance and encouraging social distancing and handwashing at least twice daily. Educators and the teachers association are unhappy that they were not consulted in establishing the guidelines for schools and were not provided with an option to teach remotely.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Austin area set a record for the number of daily new cases. Austinís mayor is now considering a stay-at-home order. The local health authority recommended mandatory mask wearing for one year. As of July 1, more than 300 children and 600 staff in child care facilities have been tested positive for COVID-19 and the number continues increasing. Masks are now required in Texas. On June 26, Texas closed its bars in response to increasing cases in cities. Businesses are protesting the closure of bars. Additional federal funding will support Texas hospitals and patients with Medicaid. Local officials are concerned over potentially overwhelming hospitalizations in major Texas cities.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With more than 5000 new daily cases, Texas has a record number of hospitalizations and is seeing a general rise in cases compared to last week. The governor is requesting Texans to stay home and warns that restrictions may be announced if the infection rate continues. The governor paused the stateís reopening at phase 3 of 4 on June 25 after a daily increase of almost 6000 cases. Texas mayors and county judges now have the right to implement restrictions on outdoor gatherings greater than 100 people. Some health officials and Harris County officials are demanding stricter stay-at-home orders. A Houston university professor estimates that Texas ICUs will fill over the next two weeks and contribute to increasing mortality rates and limited treatment abilities. Republican Senator Ted Cruz is contesting a federal decision to revoke funding for 13 community-based COVID-19 testing centres by the end of June, which affects seven Texas areas that have increasing COVID-19 cases.</p>
