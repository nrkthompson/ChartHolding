  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">With more than 5000 new daily cases, Texas has a record number of hospitalizations and is seeing a general rise in cases compared to last week. The governor is requesting Texans to stay home and warns that restrictions may be announced if the infection rate continues. The governor paused the stateâ€™s reopening at phase 3 of 4 on June 25 after a daily increase of almost 6000 cases. Texas mayors and county judges now have the right to implement restrictions on outdoor gatherings greater than 100 people. Some health officials and Harris County officials are demanding stricter stay-at-home orders. A Houston university professor estimates that Texas ICUs will fill over the next two weeks and contribute to increasing mortality rates and limited treatment abilities. Republican Senator Ted Cruz is contesting a federal decision to revoke funding for 13 community-based COVID-19 testing centres by the end of June, which affects seven Texas areas that have increasing COVID-19 cases.</p>
