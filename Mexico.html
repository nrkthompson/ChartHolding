  <h5>September 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">A Mexico City government report indicates that COVID-19 deaths in the city were under-reported by approximately 10,000 deaths between March and August. The US-Mexico land and sea border closure to non-essential travel has been extended until October 21. For the two week period of September 14 to September 27, Mexico’s stoplight indicator system shows, for the first time, no states in the red or maximum risk category. Instead, 24 states are in the orange or high risk category, and eight states are in the yellow or medium risk category. No states are in the green or low risk category. Public use of Cancun beaches is now permitted. Hotel occupancy in Tulum in the Quintana Roo region is at approximately 32%, which is the highest that it has been since the area reopened. For the first time since February, Mexico’s employment rate is rising; 92,000 jobs were recovered in August. This represents approximately 8.2% of the jobs lost over the last five months. Six former health ministers published a report that criticized the federal COVID-19 response. Their report advocates for a national testing campaign, localized lockdowns and mandatory mask use. The deputy minister of health publicly mocked the report and its suggestions.</p>
  <h5>September 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">COVID-19 cases “declined or remained stable” for six consecutive weeks from mid-July until late August. A report indicated that Russia’s sovereign wealth fund would supply a Mexican pharmaceutical firm, Landsteiner, with 32 million doses of Sputnik-V, the Russian COVID-19 vaccine. Deliveries are scheduled for November pending Mexican officials’ approval. The Deputy Minister of Health anticipates that the majority of Mexican states will be in green or stage four of reopening by the end of October; however, he suggests that some states will not enter that stage until November. On August 31, nine states entered the orange stage, or stage two of reopening, in the Mexican traffic light system for August 31 to September 13. As of September 4, Mexico City, Nuevo Leon and Quintana Roo were relaxing some of their COVID-19 restrictions. On September 7, Mexico City allowed restaurants, department stores and malls to extend their operating hours with a 30% capacity limit. Mexico City authorities will begin discussing reopening strategies with gym owners. Mexico City bars, cantinas and other entertainment places have been open for approximately four weeks with mandatory table service. Nuevo Leon is in orange, or stage two of reopening, and on September 4 allowed various businesses to reopen. The state’s governor will be meeting with mayors in the region to discuss reopening plans for various entertainment facilities, gyms, conventions centres, museums, tattoo parlors and casinos with 30% capacity. Nuevo Leon will allow sports leagues to resume but not party halls, clubs and bars. Quintana Roo will be in yellow, or stage three of reopening, during the week of September 14 and will reopen beaches, archaeological sites and increase gym capacity to 70% in open areas and 50% in closed areas. Hospitals, hotels, theme parks, theatres, cinemas, malls, hair salons and religious places will be permitted to operate at 60% capacity.</p>
  <h5>August 24, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Mexican officials reported a decrease in new cases nationally, along with a significant decrease in fatalities and a reduction in hospitalization. However, the number of COVID-19 cases in Baja California and Zacatecas has increased substantially. Germany is donating 100,000 PCR tests to Mexico. AstraZeneca will conclude phase three of its vaccine trials in November or December and will then solicit government permission to sell it. If the process goes according to plan, Mexico will begin administering the vaccine around April. Mexico and Argentina intend to produce 150 million doses in early 2021, with a minimum of 400 million doses available for distribution in Latin America. Aguascalientes regressed from orange to red on the federal government’s traffic light indicators; however, the region disagrees with the federal government’s reclassification. Aguascalientes officials said that they should instead be classified as yellow since their number of new COVID-19 cases is stable and--despite of the recent rise in hospital occupancy--they argue that they have enough hospital space and medical supplies. The officials also said they have one of the highest testing rates in Mexico. The US-Mexico land border will remain closed to nonessential travel until September 21. While there are currently no general restrictions on American tourists flying into Mexico, screening levels vary depending on which Mexican airport visitors arrive at. Many American tourists are visiting the Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta and Cancun areas.</p>
  <h5>August 17, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Airbus has donated PPE to the Mexican armed forces. Mexico and Argentina signed a deal to produce the British AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for the majority of Latin America. In collaboration with two Chinese and one American medical company, the federal government has allowed phase three trials of COVID-19 vaccines in Mexico. Mexico was the first country to address the need for universal access to COVID-19 vaccines in the G20 and presented a resolution addressing this in the UN. As of August 16, Campeche will be the first state in the yellow stage on the government’s reopening stoplight, after a 23% decrease in cases. All businesses and public spaces may open, although public spaces will be at reduced capacity. Six states remain in red, 25 in orange, one in yellow, and zero in green, according to the government’s reopening stoplight. Although the federal traffic light identifies Mexico City as orange, the head of the Mexico City government explained that the capital’s museums and other cultural sites will open at 30% capacity beginning August 11 and 12. Movie theaters reopened on August 12 in Mexico City. Playa del Carmen is reopening beaches as a test. Public beaches in Cancun remain closed. Foreign Policy magazine ranked Mexico 34th of 36 nations for their policy response during the pandemic and claimed that it was amongst the worst because of a weak financial response, limited testing, and bad public health policy.</p>
  <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The government reported that as of August 6, seven states were still experiencing an increase in COVID-19 cases. By contrast, 14 states are now stabilizing or experiencing a decrease in cases. The deputy minister of health appealed to people to wear masks, particularly indoors. Most car assemblers have increased production in Mexico in order to return to their production levels prior to COVID-19. From August 6 to 21, registration and re-registration for schools are scheduled to take place; the school year will begin remotely by August 24. Teachers will receive training on digital tools and equity between August 10 and September 11. Schools are only permitted in person once the region has been given a green light on the federal government’s reopening stoplight system. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) predicts that the pandemic in Mexico will peak in August and that, while the government had helped to slow the spread of the virus, it has not brought virus transmission fully under control.</p>
  <h5>August 4, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Mexico has the fourth highest death toll from COVID-19 globally, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Cancun, Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos--three major Mexican travel destinations--have reopened and are accepting tourists, despite the continued closure of the US-Mexico land border. San Felipe in Baja California has reopened to Mexican tourists and to local tourism, but the area is restricting foreign tourism because of the COVID-19 situation in California. To protect Mexicans, Baja California will continue to limit access to the area with exceptions for essential services. The region’s reopening allows access to beaches and hotel capacity up to 30%. As of July 30, malls reopened with sanitary measures and social distancing rules. Bars and movie theaters are expected to reopen during the week of August 3. For the period spanning August 3 to 16, approximately half of Mexico is expected to be in the red category, which is phase one of the federal government’s reopening plan. The other half will be  placed in the orange category, which is phase two of reopening. Federal health officials and state governments will meet during the week of August 3 to review the protocol for placing states in the reopening categories. The federal reopening stoplight system has been openly contested by some states that have decided not to follow it. Approximately nine governors have called for Deputy Health Minister Lopez-Gatell’s resignation because of the negative impact of closure recommendations on local economies and the high COVID-19 death toll in Mexico.</p>
  <h5>July 27, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Three Royalton resort locations are opening in Mexico. The land border between the US and Mexico is closed to non-essential travel until August 21. US visitors are permitted into Mexico through flights where travellers may face temperature checks and other health screening measures. Local unions and other private actors in Jalisco expressed disagreement with the federal government’s traffic light system of state-level COVID classifications because the federal government classified Jalisco at the red level. These local unions and private actors said that the ranking does not accurately reflect the state’s COVID-19 situation—pointing to several favourable indicators, including:  the fourth lowest incidence per 100,000 inhabitants, the 11th lowest mortality rate, hospital occupancy levels between 25-30%, and the first state to approve prevention and social distancing measures.</p>
  <h5>July 20, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">As of July 15, Nuevo Leon reported hospital occupancy at 73%; the state is red on the government’s traffic light system. As of July 15, nine Mexican states reported an increase in COVID-19 cases; however, Tabasco and Nuevo Leon have been the only states to report COVID-19 hospitalizations at around 80%. Federal authorities will release rules for beaches to lower risks associated with the spread of COVID-19. The rules will include masks at beaches and in common spaces, capacity limits, frequently cleaning hammocks, reserving beach time and banning recreational sports. The government also intends to: launch information campaigns; provide food, medical and financial aid to families of those with COVID-19; close street markets in areas at the red level; and to designate hotspots as such for a minimum of 15 days. Thirty-four areas are at the red level on the government traffic light map for the week of July 13. On July 17, the map showed nine states regressing from orange to red, and six states progressing from red to orange. Reports indicate that Mexico is doing 65 tests per million people, which is below the average of 305 for Latin American and Caribbean countries.  The reports also suggested that the number of confirmed cases is high based on the available information. The United Nations Development Program reiterated that underreporting could provide incorrect information for risk assessment and create a false sense of security.  It suggested that Mexico should conduct serological research to understand the actual presence of the virus and the influence of potentially contributing factors such as socioeconomic conditions.</p>
  <h5>July 13, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The Mexican government received 88 ventilators from China. The regional government in Nuevo Leon is hiring 500 additional medical staff, including doctors and nurses. In reopening regionally, Nuevo Leon opened 100% of essential factories and commerce and services, 50% of non-essential factories, and reduced hours for shopping centers and restaurants. But gyms, casinos, cinemas, large events, museums, pools, sports, stadiums, spas, bars, villa rentals and bike routes will remain closed. In Mexico City, which is at the orange level in Mexico’s reopening plan, they will reopen 601 shopping centers and department stores--which will allow approximately 66,490 people to return to work. Federally, for the first week since its release, the government did not update their reopening stoplight map and blamed the states for inconsistent data collection. A health official was concerned about the case increases in Quintana Roo, Campeche and Yucatan, which could have resulted from opening quickly. Quintana Roo is at the orange level in federal reopening, but the region has designated the southern part of the state at the red level.  It will allow offices, hotels and restaurants to operate at a limited capacity while closing bars, clubs and cinemas. An official from the Pan American Health Organization said that the spotlight map is confusing Mexicans; another official from the WHO said that reopening amid intense community transmission could be dangerous.</p>
  <h5>July 6, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 30, Mexico surpassed Spain’s death toll. As of July 2, Mexico had the sixth highest COVID-19 death toll in the world and was the 11th highest for the number of cases. Domestically, 45% of hospital beds reserved for COVID-19 patients have been occupied and 40% of those patients need a ventilator. On June 30, public health officials reported that the pandemic was peaking in Mexico with large daily infection and hospitalization rates. On June 30, Mexico received 100 ventilators from China. For the week of June 29, 11 states remained in red, which suggests a maximum infection risk; 18 states entered high risk, which is orange; and four states regressed from orange to red. For the week of July 6, five states regressed from orange to red and four proceeded to orange. Cumulatively, most of Mexico was at the orange risk level. Orange allows restrictions to be eased for gyms, pools, churches, restaurants, cafes, hotels, theaters, museums, markets and appointment-based barber and beauty salon visits. Although Mexico City has the most active cases, it entered orange during the week of June 29 because their number of hospitalizations is declining. In Mexico City, restaurants, maids and sports center staff resumed work, but cinemas, theaters, bars, clubs, museums, casinos and gyms will remain closed. The government cautions people to stay home and wear masks and has warned that if hospitalizations increase to 65% again, Mexico City will return to red in terms of reopening. A University of California professor criticized Mexico’s performance with respect to testing, contact tracing and social distancing. On June 30, Johns Hopkins researchers said that it did not appear that the virus had peaked yet in Mexico.</p>
  <h5>June 26, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 21, Mexico reported over 1000 COVID-19 deaths and an increase of confirmed cases to 5000, but the government claims that the deaths include those from May and the beginning of June. Mexico City has the most accumulated cases, active cases and deaths. Mexico state is ranked second, and Tabasco, Veracruz and Baja California are ranked third, fourth, and fifth respectively for accumulated cases. The fatality rate in Mexico is 12 per 100 cases and approximately 65% of the deceased are men older than 50. On June 23, a government health official described Mexico as stabilizing; the percentage of available beds increased to 56% and the average number of deaths stabilized around 450 daily. The government has ranked 17 states at level orange and the rest at level red, where only some non-essential services may resume. Colima and Hidalgo progressed from red to orange this week, and Tabasco regressed from orange to red. After reopening 18 days ago with hotels, restaurants and beaches reopening with restrictions, Baja California saw a case increase of greater than 100%, a 64% mortality rate increase and increased hospitalization. While federal government infrastructure projects and major projects continued, private sector construction was deemed non-essential and paused. Volkswagen, Audi and some auto parts suppliers reopened plants on June 22; however, Governor Barbossa-Huerta of Puebla asked companies to reconsider given the high level of cases. Several cities and states have received the Travel Safety Stamp from the World Travel and Tourism Council and want to resume tourism, particularly local tourism. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is reopening offices to process legal documents and for consular protection cases and on July 1 in addition to the 20 that have been opening across Mexico, four more foreign delegations will reopen.</p>
  <h5>June 19, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Mexican scientists are exploring sofosbuvir as a COVID-19 treatment. The Deputy Minister of Health continues encouraging Mexicans to limit contact, social distance and wear masks. Parts of Mexico have plateaued while other areas are experiencing more or fewer COVID-19 cases. Mexico's reopening stoplight indicators are determined by case trends, hospital admissions and occupancy, and the number of COVID-19 positive cases. During the week of June 15, 16 states progressed from red to orange in the reopening plan. In orange, states can open: restaurants and cinemas at 50% capacity; shopping centres and religious places at 25% capacity; contact services with appointments at 50% capacity; parks, squares, public spaces, gyms, pools and sports at 50% capacity, supermarkets and markets at 75% capacity with maximum one family member inside at once; and professional sports without audiences. As of June 9, Cancun, Isla Mujeres and other tourist based regions declared themselves reopened to direct flights from the US as did some hotels that implemented sanitary measures, and capacity limits between 15% and 30% for now. Beaches, clubs and casinos remain closed in those regions. Puerto Vallarta reopened hotels with capacity limits, malls, gyms and sporting facilities. An agreement between the federal and regional governments to protect the tourism industry allows certain regions to reopen while classified as red, or locked down. The US-Mexico border is expected to remain closed to non-essential travel until July 21. Health care workers continue to protest for wage increases, medical insurance, PPE and supplies.</p>
  <h5>June 12, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Per 100,000 people, Mexico ranked seventh globally for the most COVID-19 deaths and fourteenth for the most cases as of June 9. Four states experienced increases in COVID-19 cases greater than 100%, five states reported downward trends in cases and one state maintained the same level of active cases for two weeks. Several hospitals reported themselves at capacity. On June 9, Deputy Minister of Health Hugo Lopez-Gatell stated that Mexico’s daily number of new cases had not peaked and that the country would experience additional weeks of rising daily numbers of cases. In Mexico City, masks are required. Although most of the country is in lockdown, as of June 1, with some restrictions being relaxed, general movement in Mexico increased. In lockdown, hotels have limited capacity, personal care services can be in-home with appointments, parks are open in some regions and essential services are open. With intergovernmental cooperation, preparations for the tourism sector are underway by exploring travel insurance, discounts and mobile reservations. Medical staff protest lack of appropriate PPE. The government was criticized for relaxing restrictions while the country is peaking and expert estimates for the COVID-19 death toll increased from 16,000 to between 43,000 and 51,000 this summer. Attention towards excessive police force is growing after Giovanni Lopez was killed in police custody while being detained for not wearing a mask.</p>
  <h5>June 5, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">On June 3, Mexico revealed its highest daily death toll  at 1092. On May 28, May 29 and June 2, Mexico received ventilators and PPE from the US and China. To expand their testing rate, 114 more clinics and hospitals will conduct tests and implement contact tracing techniques. On June 1, Mexico entered their final stage of reopening and implemented a traffic light system to reopen social, school and economic activities varying by region. Federal and regional governments will collaborate to determine regional reopening. Masks and social distancing are required in public. Parts of the mining, construction, auto parts, tourism, equipment manufacturing, public markets, public parks, businesses and beer production sectors resumed with restrictions. Reopening is restricted in areas with high numbers of cases, which government maps reflect as most of the country. On August 10, three week long remedial schools begin in person in regions of Mexico classified as fully open. Elementary schools will resume during the first week of September, and middle and upper level schools will resume in person on September 21 with health restrictions. Mexican experts concur with the stoplight system, but disagree with the timing and suggest that the country has not plateaued and that restrictions should ease after a two week decline of cases. Experts advocate for more testing and different health measures for public transport. Caravan protests in 40 cities called for President Lopez-Obrador’s resignation; the president responded by reminding protestors of opportunities in 2021 and 2022 to remove him from office before his mandate ends in 2024.</p>
  <h5>May 29, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">The WHO praised Mexico’s response to the pandemic for their economic support plan and their decision to maintain Mexico’s epidemiological response plan to COVID-19 until the situation improves. Mexico received masks and ventilators from China on May 22 and 23. Mexico will not fully reopen until a vaccine is circulated, but as companies begin reopening some companies committed to doing employee testing. The Mexico-US border will remain closed to non-essential travel until June 22. As of May 18, construction, mining and automaking reopened. On June 1, the Mexican reopening plan will incorporate a traffic light system to reopen different sectors of society in different regions. Mexico City remains closed until minimum June 15 with exceptions for essential services. Depending on the number of  hospitalizations, the capital will reopen hotels and cinemas in July, schools and offices in August followed by bars and gyms in September. At a press conference on May 29th, the government explained that most, but not all, of Mexico remained locked down, which would gradually ease and allow more non-essential services to reopen as of June 1st based on risk and expected social value. Companies must register with the government virtually prior to reopening. Schools will continue virtual learning with free textbooks and various educational telecommunications programs. To reopen schools, regions must achieve green status, or the final stage of reopening, but the government anticipates that remedial courses will reopen in person in August and schools in September. The Maya Train project in the Chiapas is reopening. Cancun and Mexico will be one of the first locations in the Americas to receive approval through the Global Safety Stamp by the World Travel and Tourism Council.</p>
  <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Mexico City expects their peak between the end of May and beginning of June. Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab therapies are authorized by relevant government agencies and are being tested in hospitals. Mexico is looking to approve additional therapies including using convalescent plasma. 2000 ventilators arrived from the US and an 11th flight arrived from China with ventilators, COVID-19 tests, gloves, and material to produce N95 masks. Although authorized in Mexico’s reopening plan, 26 out of approximately 203 municipalities in Oaxaca that reported no COVID-19 cases decided not to reopen on May 18th. As of May 18th, construction, mining, and automaking services could resume and approximately 28 textile and automotive companies received approval from the Secretary of Health to reopen with 20-30% of their workforce. The government requests people stay home until May 30th and insists reopening will be gradual. In preview of a second wave of COVID-19 in October, the government may enforce additional measures regionally to avoid the negative impact of national restrictions. The government may also keep the changes that they made to public hospitals that increased their patient capacity and will continue buying supplies and PPE from China to stay equipped. Medical staff continue protesting the quality and quantity of available PPE and other supplies. Some governors are not pleased with how federalism worked during the pandemic and argue that it should be reviewed.</p>
